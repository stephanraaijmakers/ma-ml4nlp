Bart?	Victory party under the slide!
I didnt vote. Votings for geeks.	Well, you got that right. Thanks for your vote, girls.
We forgot.	Well, dont sweat it. Just so long as a couple of people did... right, Milhouse?
Uh oh.	Lewis?
Lewis?	Somebody must have voted.
What about you, Bart? Didnt you vote?	Uh oh.
One for Martin, two for Martin. Would you like another recount?	No.
Baboon!	Whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. I just cant believe it was her.
Hey, whats the matter, son?	Ah, Dad, if just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted...
Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?	No.
Would you have to do extra work?	Yeah.
And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?	Well, no.
So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? Thats my motto.	Hey! Thanks, monkey-man.
But Mom, I want to hear the witty banter of sophisticated adults.	Yeah, you cant have any fun in bed.
Homer, these novelty ice cubes are often made from highly toxic chemicals. Ironically, a real fly would have been much more sanitary.	Please Dad.
Bart! Come over here.	What?
You little monkey... youre a little monkey, arent you?	Yes sir.
Bart, do that thing you do thats so cute.	What?
That thing you know how to do.	What?
About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably dont understand why.	I understand why. You were wasted.
I admit it. I didnt know when to say when. Im sorry it happened and I just hope you didnt lose a lot of respect for me.	Dad, I have as much respect for you as I ever did or ever will.
Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!	Now you wanna go?
Simpson... Simpson...	Come back for more, eh?
Oh dear. If we cant find a babysitter, we cant go. What a kick in the teeth.	What do you need a babysitter for? Im almost ten and a half.
Mom! You wouldnt dare.	Dont take that tone with me, young lady, or Ill give you a taste of the back of me hand.
I heard that.	Grampa, Mom was in such a hurry, she forgot to give you this. Its a list of the things Lisa and I can and cant do.
Bart, Grampas a kindly old man who trusts us. Are you sure its right to take advantage of him?	Lis, in these crazy, topsy-turvy times, whos to say whats right or wrong? But right now my guts telling me... Bleed Gramps dry.
Half a gallon of chocolate.	Check.
Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.	Check.
Half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip.	Check.
Grampa, what a question?	Whats next, Lis?
Sprinkles and syrup.	Hey, Grampa. Aisle six and step on it.
You know, kids, its gettin pretty late.	Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. Weve had a big day.
Yes. Ten please.	Hey Grampa, top me off.
Are you sure your ma lets you kids drink coffee?	For the last time, yes!
Cherry party, Bart. Any chicks over eight?	Not yet, but the afternoon is young.
Not yet, but the afternoon is young.	Lisa, whats wrong?
Isnt it obvious? Weve degraded ourselves and set back the childrens rights movement for decades to come.	Youre great at a party, Lisa. Really great.
I tried to be a good baby-sitter, but I failed! Im a feeb... a useless old... worn-out...	Lisa, I have this strong unpleasant feeling Ive never had before.
Its called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth.	Well, how do you make this feeling go away?
Hi, honey. Uh, oh. Hows the marriage retreat going?	Please Dad.
Way to go, Grampa.	Ill never trust another old person.
Hurry, Mom! If we dont get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone.	Wow! Number nine! Thats before Fallout Boy became his ward.
Wow! Number nine! Thats before Fallout Boy became his ward.	What do you care about good comics? All you ever buy is Casper the Wimpy Ghost.
I think its sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and I hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity.	Well, you know what I think? I think Caspers the ghost of Richie Rich.
Hey, they do look alike!	I wonder how Richie died?
Kids, could you lighten up a little?	Now, Radioactive Man He rules! Never punches a bad guy without saying something cool.
Hes no wittier than the next superhero.	Oh, yeah? Look. He knocks a guy into the sun and says, Hot enough for ya?
Too bad we didnt come dressed as popular cartoon characters.	This looks like a discount for...
This looks like a discount for...	Bartman!
Who are you supposed to be?	Im Bartman!
Never heard of him. Full price.	Lousy rip off...
Excuse me, sir. Has anyone turned in a left Vulcan ear?	Please Dad.
Hey, Bart-dude!	Hey, Otto-man! Oooh, whats that?
My very own idea for a comic book, little man. Its about a dude who drives a school bus by day, but by night, fights vampires in a post-apocalyptic warzone!	Cool!
Cmon, Bart. Were going to see Buddy Hodges.	The guy who played Fallout Boy on TV?
Yep.	Wow, I guess he wasnt killed in Vietnam.
I am sure I dont know. But I did just finish playing Rum Tum Tugger in the second national touring company of Cats -- anybody see it?	Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Over here, Fallout Boy! Oh, oh, me... me... me... me, me.
Yes, you, the masked boy.	Do you think the ghost of Dirk Richter haunts the bordello where his bullet-riddled body was found?
Behold!	Wow. Radioactive Man Number One.
None other.	I bet its worth a million bucks!
It is, my lad. But Ill let you have it for a hundred because you remind me of me.	All I got is thirty.
Then you cannot have it.	But I must. Until this moment, I never knew why God put me on this earth, but now I know... to buy that comic book.
I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!	All right, Homer. Whoa, you really are a sport, Dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like Krusty Burger!
All right, what are you getting at?	I need a hundred dollars for a comic book.
A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?	Oh please, Dad. I want this more than anything in the world.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No.	Please Dad.
No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so Im not mad at you for trying. It shows youve been paying attention. But we all know Im not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Are you?	Okay.
So maybe a part-time job is the answer.	Aw, Mom, I couldnt ask you to do that. Youre already taking care of Maggie, and Lisa is such a handful --
She means you should get a job, stupid.	Me?
Bart! What are you staring at?	Uh... nothing.
Bart! Stop it!	Sorry.
I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY... AHH	Empty bottles... empty bottles...
Empty bottles... empty bottles...	Hm... well, its practically empty.
Ooh, very good. Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a Jumbo Cherry Squishie?	No, not today. I need the dime.
Okey dokey.	All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
Hows it going, Bart?	Terrible. Cars slow down to laugh at me, but no ones buying.
Ah ha, now you look pathetic.	Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Lets see... ... Ah!
Lemonade sucks. I need a new product. Lets see... ... Ah!	Form a line, no crowding. Cheap beer and a sympathetic ear... Step right up.
Ah, Bart could you give me one on credit? Im a little short this week.	Beat it.
Say, uh, you got a liquor license there, young fella?	Ugh, my dog ate it.
Gotta have a license to sell beer.	Say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. How about a couple on the house?
I guess we can overlook this.	So long, officers. Uh-oh.
Would you like something to eat? Ive got dried apricots... almond paste, sauerkraut candy.	No, thanks. Whos that?
Here, have some ribbon candy. Boys love candy.	No, thanks.
Boys love candy.	Oh, yes, maam!
Oh, yes, maam!	Ugh, I think Id rather just get to work, Maam.
I want you to clear out all the weeds. You do know which ones are weeds?	All of em?
Now be careful with these. Ill be inside watching my stories.	Ow!. . .Ow!
Filthy, but genuinely arousing.	Finished.
Now, dont fidget.	Listen, lady, you dont have to -- YAAAUUUUGGGHHH!
Did you make any money?	Not yet, but at least Im in a lot of pain.
Well, I think what youre doing for Mrs. Glick is very nice. The poor old thing doesnt have anybody.	Theres a reason.
The sludge certainly collects around those downspouts, dont it?	Ill sludge you, you old bat.
Today, we wash Beulah. Do you know what that is?	Some old lady thing, nobodys heard about for fifty years?
No, it was my wedding dress, but then I dyed it black and it became my mourning dress.	Great story, lady.
Great story, lady.	Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms.
Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms.	No! No, not the iodine! Burn the germs off with a torch, amputate my arm, but not the -- YAAAUUUGGGHHH!
Two quarters.	Two quarters?
You deserve every penny. You know, Ive told a lot of my girlfriends about you and they have chores too.	Two quarters!
Bart, you didnt say thank you.	Listen lady, I can leave without screaming, and I can leave without saying a bad word, but theres no way that I am saying thank you.
Whats the problem, boy?	Ive been bustin my hump all week for that withered old clam, and all I got was fifty cents.
Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money.	Really?
Nah.	Dad, Ive done everything I could and Ive only got thirty-five bucks. Ugh.. I am through with working. Working is for chumps.
No way. What do you want?	Can I have it for thirty-five?
Show me the thirty bucks, because if you aint got it, I aint gettin off the stool.	Wait a minute, Martin. If you, Milhouse and I went in together, we could buy a copy of Radioactive Man No. 1 right now!
Freakin kids!	Look, pal. Weve got a hundred bucks and wed like to buy Radioactive Man No. 1. So why dont you just waddle over there and get it.
Yes sir.	Wow! Breathe it in, boys!
It smells like my grandpa.	Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home.
Uh-oh, looks like rain. We better get this baby home.	Uh-oh.
I wouldve thought being hit by an atomic bomb would have killed him.	Now you know better.
Turn the page, Bart.	Listen, you guys are welcome to come over and read it any time you like.
Why cant we keep it at my house?	Your house? Thats crazy talk!
How about this, guys. Bart can have it Mondays and Thursdays. Milhouse will get it Tuesdays and Fridays. And yours truly will take it Wednesdays and Saturdays.	Perfect.
Wait a minute. What about Sunday?	Yeah. What about Sunday?
Well, Sunday possession will be determined by a random number generator. I will take the digits one through three. Milhouse will have four through six. And Bart will have seven through nine.	Perfect.
Wait a minute. What about zero?	Yeah! What about zero?
Excellent! Well, today being Saturday, Gentlemen, I guess Ill be taking my comic and...	Uh, uh, uh, ah nice try, Martin. It almost worked. But tonight, this comic book stays right here.
Me too!	Fine. Were all going to stay here with the comic book. Itll be like a sleep-over. Yeah, a sleep-over. Thats what pals do, right? Real friendly-like.
I want to read it again.	Nice try, mister.
Milhouse, the acids in your hands could damage the newsprint. We want to keep this comic forever, so the last one alive will have the honor of being buried with it.	What do you mean, the last one alive?
I meant years from now.	Yeah, sure you did.
Bart, dont push him!	I knew it. Youre both against me! Well, nobody makes a sap out of Bartholemew J. Simpson.
Thank you, Mrs. Simpson.	Sweet dreams, boys.
I have to go to the bathroom, Bart.	Yeah, right, so do I, but you dont see me gettin up.
Hey, whats going on?	Our dear friend Martin was trying to steal the comic book.
Bart, is this how you treat all your guests?	Hmp, impressive.
Hmp, impressive.	Quiet, Piggy, or well stick an apple in your mouth. We cant take any chances. Well have to take turns watching him.
Okay. Ill go first.	Oh, so thats your little game. Let old Bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!
Oh, so thats your little game. Let old Bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!	Well, it is not going to happen, see?
Youre going crazy, Bart. Im telling your mom!	Hey Martin, tell him what we do with squealers.
You cant stop me.	The hell I cant!
Dont let go of me Bart!	Milhouse, its not that far to the ground. And the rain has probably softened it up a bit.
You know, if you guys hadnt tied me up, I could be saving the comic as we speak.	Shut up! Shut up!
Boys, you better come in the house. You dont want to get the sniffles.	Aw, Mom.
Its no use, fellows. Another comic book has returned to the earth from whence it came.	We worked so hard and now its all gone... We ended up with nothing because the three of us cant share.
Whats your point?	Nothing. It just kind of ticks me off.
Four B.	How many teeth do I have?
I dont want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three.	Allergies.
Butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.	And?
Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! Youve got a date with a needle!	Hey, wait a minute. I dont have to give blood. I have rights, you know.
Bart, its not like Im asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! Youre a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich mans life, he showers you with riches. Dont you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?	Is it a Bible story?
Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches.	How did a lion get rich?
It was the olden days!	Oh.
Marge, youre my wife and I love you very much. But youre living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats...	Yeah, Mom. We got hosed!
Dear Mr. Burns. Im so glaaad you enjoyed my sons blood. And your caard was just great. In case you cant tell, Im being sarcastic. You stink! Could you read that last part back to me?	You stink.
Good. You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like...	An elephants butt?
Bart, have you seen the letter?	Yup.
All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?	The last place I saw it...
Uh huh.	...was in my hand...
Yeah...	...as I was shoving it into the mailbox.
Why did you do that?	Dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. And I know you. Youre an emotional guy. Just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee youd be mad in the morning. So I...
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.	Give it up, Homer. Its locked up tight.
Hey, Im with you, Homer. Fight the power!	Why the hose, Homer?
What does it look like? Ill get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it.	Yeah, but dont other people have mail in there?
Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal.	Dad, the mailman is here.
Thats a good one. Well use that.	No, I mean the mailmans here.
Can I help you?	They always told me I was gonna destroy the family, but I never believed it.
Moes Tavern. Where the elite meet to drink.	Eh, yeah, hello, is Mike there? Last name, Rotch.
To show theres no hard feelings, please take an advance copy of my book, Will There Ever Be A Rainbow? And now, young fellow, I havent forgotten you. Here.	Wow! A crowbar!
What did I tell you? Ill bet its filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls...	Wow! A big ugly head!
Actually, son, its a big, ugly Olmec Indian head. It was carved by Meso-American Indians over 3,000 years ago. This gruesome customer is Xttapalatakettle, the god of war.	Awesome!
Save a guys life, and whattaya get? Nothin! Worse than nothin! Just a big, scary rock.	Hey, man, dont bad-mouth the head.
Homer, its the thought that counts. The moral of this story is, A good deed is its own reward.	Hey, we got a reward. The head is cool!
Bart... Bart... Hey, Bart.	Lisa? Its six a.m. Somethings wrong! Dad died!
No, no. Hes fine.	Well, what do you know? Im relieved.
Bart, my birthday is in two days. Im gonna be eight years old. Its a big number -- almost double digits.	Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesnt taste as good anymore --
Well, enjoy it while you can. Everything changes when you hit the big one-oh. Your legs start to go... candy doesnt taste as good anymore --	Lisa did it.
Bart, will you please let me pour my little heart out?	Sorry, this old timer does ramble on sometimes, dont he?
Bart, I do so much for you and yet you have disappointed me on every one of my birthdays. Ive made things for you. But youve lost or broken them in hours... but, okay, well forget all...	Okay, uh-huh. Okay, okay,. Okay, okay, okay okay, its done! Im doing it! Birthday gift coming your way!
Bart, watch Maggie while I get the laundry.	Can do.
Can do.	Hm... Krusty hotline.
Bart, I asked you to watch your sister!	I tried to stop her but she overpowered me.
I dont know how this could have happened.	Ah, my lucky red hat. Clean as a whistle!
Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?	LISA ITS YOUR BIRTHDAY /
No deal.	Dad, maybe you should do this.
Son, its no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?	Oh, yeah.
Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!	Hey, Dad. Do you hear voices?
Yes, Im hearing one right now, while Im trying to watch TV.	Yes. Are you quick to anger?
Bart! Shut up or Ill shut you up!	Yes. Do you wet your pants? Well, even the best of us has an occasional accident.
Arrghh!	HAPPY BIRTHDAY LISA /
Bart, in the split second before he died, I bet Scratchy appreciated his birthday present. You see how this relates to us?	Hey, you want that once a year empty gesture. You got it, sis.
Hello. Who is this?	Im Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?
Im Michael Jackson.	The Michael Jackson? No way!
Its true. Im with your father, in a mental institution.	Uh-huh. And is Elvis with you?
He could be. Its a big hospital.	Aw, come on. If youre really Michael Jackson, who were your last four dates for the Grammys?
Brooke Shields, Diana Ross, Emmanuel Lewis and Bubbles.	Shiver me timbers, you are Michael Jackson. Can you stay on the line while I get all my friends and relatives?
Thats all right, son.	Well, theres probably a down-size I dont see. Uh-huh... New Bedlam Asylum... loves us... needs us... fears he may never see us again... Got it... Michael Jackson. Whoo-hoo! I love you, man.
Well, theres probably a down-size I dont see. Uh-huh... New Bedlam Asylum... loves us... needs us... fears he may never see us again... Got it... Michael Jackson. Whoo-hoo! I love you, man.	Hey Mom, Dads in a mental institution.
I told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house.	No, mom, you said poor house.
I said crazy house!	Poor house.
Crazy house!	Poor house.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME / HAPPY BIRTHDAY, OVERLOOKED MIDDLE CHILD -- HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME.	Joes Taxidermy. You snuff em, we stuff em.

No.	Oh well, who cares. Michael Jackson is coming to my house!
Here he is! Heres the guy you wanna see.	Huh?
Bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before I join them I have one question Today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and Im afraid to ask.	You know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask.
Hey, Bart.	Hey... you.
Hey... you.	I WISH YOU BETTER THAN YOUR HEART DESIRE /
Bart, when I was a kid, I didnt have much money. So you know what I did when my sisters birthdays rolled around?	Stiffed em?
No. I wrote them a song. To show that I cared.	I cant write a song. Im only ten.
Only ten? When I was your age I had six gold records.	Hey, Looney Tunes, this is what Michael Jackson looks like. You look like a big fat mental patient.
Youd be amazed how often I hear that.	Just leave me alone.
Look boy, either Michael Jackson is some guy working in a recording studio in LA or hes here with you willing to work on this song. Its your choice. So long.	Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the piano and Ill boil some coffee.
Wait, wait, Michael! You go sit at the piano and Ill boil some coffee.	LISA, HER TEETH ARE BIG AND GREEN / LISA, SHE SMELLS LIKE GASOLINE / LISA, DA DA DA DEESA / SHE IS MY SIS-TA, HER BIRTHDAY I MISSED-TA.
Bart, weve got to get to your real feelings about your sister.	I dont have any.
Ah, she looks sad.	Thats cause she knows youre looking at her.
Bart, think. What happens to you when you turn eight?	Well, your training wheels come off your bike.
Good. Thats good. THE TRAINING WHEELS COME OFF YOUR BIKE / YOU START TO NOTICE BOYS YOU LIKE...HEE, HEE, HEE.	Youre just putting that in because its commercial.
Youre just putting that in because its commercial.	Lisa... Lisa... Lisa.
Huh... wha-- Bart, its six a.m.	Thats right! Hope you like your present. And a-one, and a-two, and a one, two, three, four --

Daaad!	Hey, what gives, man?
Thank you, Homie.	Wow, little meatloaf men!
Bart, maybe this is something youd like to do, too.	Mom, its a nice thought, but we both know that this is the pony to bet on.
Little boy, I bet youd like to visit the cockpit.	Oh baby!
And this control stick is like the handlebars on your tricycle. Now, would you like to see where we hang our coats?	No thank you, Id rather push this button.
Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off.	Hey, I call first bedsies!
Bart! Theres no such thing as first bedsies. You just made that up.	Well, okay, which one do you want?
Iiiiiii Waaaaaannt... That one.	Really, you want that one? Its all yours. Whatever you say.
Why? Whats wrong with it?	Nothing! Have a good nights sleep, Lisa.
No, really, what?	Nothing.
What did you do to it?	Nothing.
Stupid welcoming mint! Yello.	Good morning. This is your wake-up call.
Wake-up call? Its two AM!	Sorry fatso.
Your laundry, sir.	There you go... buy yourself something nice.
Bart, are you ready to go to... Ill room service you...	Before you kill me, remember, this trip is All Expenses Paid.
THE DEFICIT RAG / OH, YEAH, THE DEFICIT RAG / THOSE BUDGET GAPS CAN BE A TWELVE-DIGIT DRAG / IM TELLIN YA THATS THE DEFICIT / THEY REALLY MADE A MESS OF IT / THATS THE DEFICIT RA-A-G! Thank you!	Oh, this guy is awful.
The city of Washington was built on a stagnant swamp some 200 years ago, and very little has changed. It stank then, and it stinks now. Only today, it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air.	Cool! A ruckus!
THE TRADING GAP SHUFFLE / WERE IN A HEAP-A TROUBLE / A-DOIN THE TRADING GAP SHUFFLE! YES SIR!	He already sang this song!
And now, the moment of truth Will the winning essay be... Bubble On, O Melting Pot... Lift High Your Lamp, Green Lady... USA A-O.K.... or Cesspool On The Potomac?	Cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool cesspool...
Bart!	Lis, you taught me to stand up for what I believe in.
Electricity!	No electricity. Electricity only in freeze tag.
Hey, no tagbacks.	Yeah, you cheater!
Bart, how many hours a day do you watch TV?	Six. Seven if theres something good on.
Dont you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise?	Yeah, but what are ya gonna do?
HA!	Hey Mom, how bout if I learn karate? Will that we make you happy?
Greetings. I am Akira, your guide on the path to true karate. And this is our map, the Art of War by Sun Tzu. It will teach us our most important lesson we learn karate so that we need never use it.	Um, excuse me, sir. I already know how not to hit a guy. Can we break out the nunchucks?
Ah, yes, the impetuousness of youth! For now, let us read.	Akira, my good man. When do we break blocks of ice with our heads?
First you must fill your head with wisdom. Then you can hit ice with it.	Yo, sensei, can I go to the bathroom?
You can, if you believe you can.	Paying money to read books... the hell with this.
Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks.	Uh, I learned the touch of death.
Ooh, the touch of death.	Permit me to demonstrate. Lisa, shut your eyes. Soon you will be at peace.
Uh-oh. Gotta get back to karate class.	You missed a spot.
You missed a spot.	All right. Comin through. Outta my way. Move it along. Step aside, lady.
Hey, boy. How was class?	Today we learned how to rip a mans heart out and show it to him before he dies.
Okay, okay.	I grow weary of this new channel. Change it back.
Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?	Sounds scrump-didly-umptious, dear old Daddly-doodly.
Im sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery.	Hey, keep your hands off my china hutch.
Hey, stop that.	Hey Lis, something wrong?
Not any more. You punks are about to get a taste of your own medicine. This is my brother... and he knows Karate.	Uh oh.
Yeah, just keep laughing, it only makes him madder. Come on, Bart, start them off with the touch of death and go from there.	I think theyve learned their lesson already, Lis.
Good mornin world!	Ow!
What are you so happy about?	Why shouldnt I be happy? Its a beautiful day, my homework is done, Ive got my mojo workin and were goin on a field trip this afternoon.
Why shouldnt I be happy? Its a beautiful day, my homework is done, Ive got my mojo workin and were goin on a field trip this afternoon.	And... looks like I got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge.
And... looks like I got me a genuine glow-in-the-dark police badge.	Hey! Its not in here. You stole it!
Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up!	Hey, thats my badge, Homer.
... Lousy prize-grabbing... badge-wearing...	You ate my homework?
You ate my homework?	I didnt know dogs really did that.
Bart Simpson! Youre late! Go fill out a tardy slip.	But Im only... ... ... five... ten... twenty... forty minutes? Thats pretty damn late.
Hey girls! Look at me!	You can stop lookin at me now.
Ah! Here we are! Heres a whole box of unsealed envelopes for the PTA.	Youre making me lick envelopes?
Oh, licking envelopes can be fun! All you have to do is make a game of it.	What kind of game?
Well... for example... you could see how many you can lick in an hour, and then try to break that record.	Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me.
You didnt believe me when I said it would be fun, did you?	No thir.
What?	Tan... Die.... Doe... Dow.
Hmm... Well theres still a minute to go... oh, why not! But dont you tell your teacher I let you go home early.	Die dont.
What next?	Uh-oh.
Hey, whats with the kid?	Hands off the material!
I wonder if he is lucky also. Pick a horse, kid. Shelbyville Downs. Third race. Make it a good one.	Eat my shorts.
Eat my shorts. Ah, okay. Lets see... Heyy... Wait a minute, you little punk! Eat My Shorts is in the fifth race. I said the third race!	Dont have a cow.
While we are waiting to see how lucky you are, let me show you around. This is our bar, and over there is our slot machine and card tables....	Cool!
Hey, I like this kid. I cant believe we were gonna shoot him. Can you mix drinks?	I dont know.
Make Legs a Manhattan.	Im not sure I...
You got a job? Doing what?	Oh... I dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin cigars... you know -- a job.
How much does it pay?	Thirty bucks a week.
Pfft. I make more than that.	I was lookin for those. Thanks, doll.
... Bart! Have you started smoking?	No.
Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought.	Theyre not mine. My boss said his warehouse was full.
Uh... Fat Tony sent me over to pick up the goods.	Right in here my man.
Bart, is your boss a crook?	I dont think so. Although it would explain an awful lot.
Me and the boys wish to thank you for hanging onto this stuff for us.	Thanks... uh... Say, are you guys crooks?
Bart, um... is it wrong to steal a loaf of bread to feed your starving family?	No.
Well, suppose you got a large starving family. Is it wrong to steal a truckload of bread to feed them?	Uh-uh.
And what if your family dont like bread, they like cigarettes?	I guess thats okay.
Now, what if instead of giving them away, you sold them at a price that was practically giving them away. Would that be a crime, Bart?	Hell no!
Enjoy your gift.	Supoib.
Whats this? What are you boys doing?	You aint seen nothin. Now beat it.
Come on, boys.	Lousy Skinner.
You are late for work.	Of course Im late for work. How can I be on time when Principal Skinner keeps me after school?
This guy Skinner causing you trouble?	He sure is, Patrone.
Children, I dont know how to break this to you, but Principal Skinner is... ... MISSING!	Uh-oh.
Hey look at me! Im Skinners body!	That is not funny, Lewis.
I heard Bart had Skinner killed by gangsters.	Thats not true! Its just a rumor! Youre engaged in speculation. I know the law. You cant prove anything.
Youre eight hours early for work. I like that.	Did you kill my principal?
Uh... Chinese guy with a mustache?	No! My principal!
Wait till I get you home, boy.	Whats that guy doing here?
Thats the guy.	Hey!
Hey Bart! I hope there are no hard feelings.	Get bent.
I deserved that. Look, I know we let you down, but me and the boys, we still think youve got a big future in racketeering and extortion.	Sorry Fat Tony. I used to think your gang was cool, but now I learned that crime doesnt pay.
Not smart.	Cool!
Hey, this is the only paper in America thats not afraid to tell the truth that everything is just fine.	To me bestest bud Milhouse, Happy Birthday, Bart.
Uh, maybe a little later, Bart.	Aw Milhouse, just cuz your mom didnt let you have a party doesnt mean you cant get a present.
I liked the party hats.	What are you girls talkin about?
Nothing.	Twins. Open your present.
Twins. Open your present.	Theyre official Krusty the Clown walkie-talkies. Ill keep one and you keep one. Now whenever you want to talk to me, just call me on the phone and tell me to turn on my walkie-talkie.
Milhouse, Id like to express my appreciation for Saturday. Jelly bean baskets, personalized noisemakers -- those little touches are what made it enduring.	Whats he talkin about?
Uh... hey, look at that dog. Isnt that somethin?	Wow, brown!
And uh, Milhouse, I think I left my pants on your roof.	You did have a party. You didnt invite me. And I thought we were best friends.
Bart, my mom wont let me be your friend anymore. Thats why you couldnt come to the party.	Whats she got against me?
She says youre a bad influence.	Bad influence my ass! How many times have I told you, never listen to your mother!
But Bart, she threatened to cut off my allowance.	Whatever shes paying you, Ill double it.
Ill think about it, Marge.	Nah. Im just depressed. Milhouses mom wont let me play with him any more.
Whats your problem, boy?	I had a fight with Milhouse.
One... two... three... Community chest.	Nah.
Nah.	Nah.
Nah.	Ah. Ive won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks.
Ah. Ive won second prize in a beauty contest. Collect ten bucks.	Ha ha! Youre losing.
Bart, dont feed your sister hotels!	Dont worry mom, theres tons of these things.
I think that game is too old for her. Why dont you go play with Milhouse?	I dont wanna play with Milhouse.
You mean you still havent made up with him?	Its his mom. She says Im a bad influence. Cmon Maggie, lets go throw rocks at that hornets nest.
Uh, I dont think so.	Who cares?! Milhouse, Ill be right there! Sorry Maggie, games over.
Who cares?! Milhouse, Ill be right there! Sorry Maggie, games over.	Hey Mom, Im friends with Milhouse again.
What makes you think I did it?	Who else would?
You be good.	I will.
Well, there was one boy who trusted me all along. Bart?	Yes, sir?
Well, thank you for calling. Good-bye.	Okay Milhouse, how many Krusty autographs should I put you down for?
A hundred.	Consider it done.
Consider it done.	YOURE WALKING ALONG THE STREET/ OR YOURE AT A PARTY/ OR ELSE YOURE ALONE/ AND THEN YOU SUDDENLY DIG... DIG... DIG.
Sweetie, Im sorry, but Krusty isnt coming to dinner again.	Aw, man.
Aw, man.	Dear Krusty, this is Bart Simpson, Krusty Buddy #16302 respectfully returning his Badge...
Bart, wipe your feet.	Why bother, theyll just get dirty again.
Ive got some good news. Krusty the Clown is coming to dinner tonight.	He is, for sure?
Yes.	God bless that clown.
Oh, hi Bart. I was just in the neighborhood. Why Krusty the Clown! What a surprise.	Milhouse. You can come in and drop the charade.
Milhouse. You can come in and drop the charade.	Krusty, you dont have to be on tonight.
Really?	Yeah, just relax and be yourself.
Hey!	Krusty, would you do the honors?
Mel Brooks is Jewish?	Krusty, are you alright?
Krusty, why dont you tell us whats wrong? Youll feel better.	Yeah, spill your guts, man.
Boy, you dont have to follow in my footsteps.	Dont worry, I dont even like using the bathroom after you.
That is so sad.	Krusty, do you think about your father a lot?
Oh, the Fourth of July. I cant believe that little boy in the pictures is you, Bart.	Yeah, Ive got a lot of fond memories.
Wow. The Concert For Bangladesh.	Goodnight, Krusty. Sorry about your dad.
Hey, did I leave my keys inside?	No!
Didnt Itchy Jr. look happy playing with his father? And didnt Scratchy Jr. look happy playing with his dad until they got run over by a thresher? Wasnt that a beautiful cartoon? For the love of God, cut to a commercial.	Poor Krusty.
A man who envies our family is a man who needs help.	Weve got to do something.
Rabbi Krustofsky? Why, I do a radio call-in show with him every Sunday night.	Really?
Gee, I mention it in my sermon every week.	Oh, oh, that radio show.
Oh, well. Why have a free T-shirt. Youll be the coolest kids on the playground.	Well put them on later. Now can you give us the rabbis address?
I bet the rabbi misses Krusty.	Hell be so happy, hell be crying in his beard.
Oh, what can I do for you, my young friends?	We came to talk to you about your son.
Okay, lets clear the board. Our next caller is a young boy from right here in Springfield.	Hello, my names Dimitri. Im a first time caller, long time listener.
But what if your example encourages others to give?	Speaking of charity, Rabbi Krustofsky, dont you think its time you forgave your son?
Bart, were gonna have to out smart him.	I dont know, hes pretty sharp. He saw right through this disguise.
Are you kids ready to order yet?	Sorry, no. Just get us another bowl of complimentary pickles.
Bart, weve been going about this all wrong. Whats the one thing rabbis prize above everything else?	Those stupid hats?
Were gonna hit him where it hurts. Right in the Judaica.	Ahhh, Noah, Noah, save us, save us... No!!
You I told to go away.	But... but... but, but Rabbi, does it not say in the Babylonian Talmud... And I quote, A child should be pushed aside with the left hand, and drawn closer with the right.
Yes.	Then doesnt your religion command you to make up with Krusty?
Eeww!	Rabbi, did not a great man say, and I quote, The Jews are a swinging bunch of people. I mean, Ive heard of persecution, but what they went through is ridiculous! But the great thing is after thousands of years of waiting and holding on and fighting, they finally made it. End quote.
Ohh, I never heard the plight of my people phrased so eloquently. Who said that, Rabbi Hillel?	Nope.
It was Judah the Pious?	Nope.
Mamonides?	Nope.
Oh, I got it -- the Dead Sea Scrolls.	Im afraid not, Rabbi. Its from Yes, I Can by Sammy Davis Jr. An entertainer like your son.
Get a good haul this year?	Heh heh heh...Jackpot!
I am very, very proud of you kids.	We would have gotten even more if Lisa could walk faster.
If you eat too much youll have nightmares.	Oh, yeah. Everybody in the family is gonna have a bad nightmare tonight.
No, Bart. Peace on Earth.	X-ray specs.
Peace on Earth.	X-ray specs.
Peace on Earth.	X-ray specs.
Peace on Earth.	X-ray spects.
Bart... Bart...	Huh?... Smatter?
Huh?... Smatter?	No.
Ill give you a candy necklace.	Climb aboard.
Thanks, Bart.	Less talk, more sleep.
And did I mention that the monster is a 10 year old boy? Quite a twist, eh? Bet you didnt see that one coming.	Good morning.
Hiya Bart!!! Hows my boy! Heh heh. Heh heh.	Every day, same old cat. Ill make him more interesting.
Every day, same old cat. Ill make him more interesting.	Oh, there. Thats better.
Now hadnt you better get ready for school?	Okay.
Your attention please. This is Principal Skinner. Bart, this ones for you. Hello ma baby, hello ma honey, hello my ragtime gal... Send me a kiss by wire..	Phone.
One... more... time! HELLO MA BABY... HELLO MA HONEY... HELLO MY RAGTIME GAL. DOUBLETIME, NOW. SEND ME A KISS BY WIRE...	I love school.
Come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please.	I want to watch Krusty.
You like attention, dont you Bart?	Do I ever!
Good night, son.	Good night, dad. You know, these last few days have been really swell. I wish there was something I could do to repay you.
Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back.	You got it.
Oh, ah, thanks boy.	I love you, dad.
My goodness, whats wrong?	We both had nightmares.
How hard can it be?	Hey, Dad. Heres one. Twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people.
Ooo, what job is that?	Grave digger.
Its your father, hes missing.	Dads missing? Get outta here.
No. Bart bit me.	Hey, man, you were crushing me. I tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab.
Wonderful. You know, I think this is the best batch weve ever had. I really do. And now, heres Bart Simpson, The Boy of a Thousand Voices.	Id like to open with my impression of Principal Skinner.
Id like to open with my impression of Principal Skinner.	Duh, look at me, Im Principal Skinner.
That young man just became the Boy of a Thousand Days Detention.	Hey, its Lunchlady Doris. I wonder what shes got for us today. Todays special is refried dog poop.
Sounds like someones angling for a pony of her own.	Hey, how come Lisa gets a pony?
Because she stopped loving me.	I dont love you either. So give me a moped.
What do I do? What do I do?	Grampa, if you wanna go right...
Yes...	... move your joystick to the left.
Yes, move the... whats a joystick? You didnt tell me...	Uh-oh, here comes a Xylon cruiser. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go into hyperspace! Ready, hit it!
Wait. Wheres the Hyperspace?	Grampa, youre the spaceship, not the...
Im the what? I thought I was this guy. Ohhh.	Games over, Grampa.
Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night Im not proud of and I dont want the kids to hear it.	Busted!
Ill work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then Im off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy.	Oh my God, she killed him.
Well, its true.	Well, its still fun to be up late.
Well, its still fun to be up late.	Hey, Homer, where ya goin?
Well, its a lot. In fact, your father had to take a second job.	The poor guy. Wheres he working?
Lisa, we cant make you give up that pony.	I can make her. Just give me five minutes alone with her.
Coming right up, sir.	And fill it to the top this time.
Oooooh! Thats one clean tombstone.	Hey, Dad, you got a power drill?
In the garage.	Check.
But Troy, how can I make it lower than thirty-nine ninety-five.	Hey, Homer, I cant find the safety goggles for the power saw.
If stuff starts flying, just turn your head.	Oh, check.
Bart!... BART!!!	What?
You dont have any hobbies, do you boy?	No, not really.
Well, thats what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?	Building a Soap Box Derby racer.
Oh, thats a hobby!	Hey, so it is.
Hey Bart, whered you get the lumber?	Well, as three-time soapbox derby champ Ronnie Beck says, Poorly guarded construction sites are a gold mine.
A conventional design.	Oh, yeah? Are you building a racer, Martin?
Hey Bart, I think theyre finally hauling your dad away.	Maybe its for the best.
Bart!... Im gonna help you build that racer.	Thanks, but Im almost done. Why dont you get back on the couch and watch TV?
Okay. No, Im gonna do it.	Sorry dad, but three time Soap Box Derby champion Ronnie Beck never needed his dads help.
What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you.	Come on Dad, itd be weird.
All right, I will! Son, I dont think you should let me help you.	Ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes.
Youre in heat four. Whoa, wheres your helmet, son?	Helmets are for wusses, Sir.
Attention, everyone. I say to those who question the value of the space program... Behold!	Aye carumba!
Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!	Its over there, Nelson.
Help! Help!	What was that?
Are you nervous son?	Dont worry, Dad, as three time Soap Box derby champion Ronnie Beck says, Gravity is my co-pilot.
Save your palliative cliches for the next poor sap, Doctor.	Is it okay to visit?
Of course.	Hey man, cool crash. Way to cheat death.
Thanks, Bart.	You had the best stick out there, man. I wish I could build em like you.
That racer transformed me into the twisted creature you see before you. Ill never race again.	If you dont race, then Nelsonll win!
Even if I wanted to, Im in no shape to do it. Unless... Bart, will you drive my car?	Oh, I dont know if I should do that. My dad and I built our car together and if I drove someone elses itd kill him. On the other hand... Ill do it.
Okay Bart, weve got a lot of work to do on that car. So, Im gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks...	Dad... I dont know how to say this, but I dont want to drive your car. Its slow, its ugly, it handles like a shopping cart...
Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But were Team Simpson.	Dad, I love you, but you taught me to win.
When did I ever teach you that?	Well, I picked it up somewhere. And if I drive Martins car I can win. Im sorry, but...
Im not pouting, you are.	Dad, you gotta come. I just got your hat out of the fridge.
Bart, if she breaks up on you, steer away from the grandstands, or else you might kill hundreds of innocent spectators. Bart what did I just tell you?	Kill spectators.
What is the matter with you?	Its my dad. Lying there on the couch drinking a beer, staring at the TV. Ive never seen him like that.
Simpson, prepare to die.	Lets rock.
Congratulations Bart. Seeing you out there brought back a lot of memories.	Thanks, Mr. Beck. I was alone out there, but someone was riding with me in spirit... This is for you, Dad.
The better man won, Simpson. You can really drive.	Thanks, Nelson, put her there.
Thanks, Nelson, put her there.	Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Loser! Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
Bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner.	Mom, I never won before. I may never win again. Nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!
Thats my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!	Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah! Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!
But first, part seven of our eye-opening look at... the bikini!	Whoa, T and A.
Bart, why are you still up?	Lisas slumber party.
Lisas slumber party.	Who can sleep with those five evil hens cackling and plotting against me?
Eeeeeewwwwww!	What the... ?
What the... ?	Aaahhh!
Aaahhh!	Ptew!! Ptew!! Im telling Mom and Dad.
Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad?	Because Im jinxed dammit!
Because Im jinxed dammit!	Ow! What was that for?
As you can see, we never did get the hang of it.	Aye carumba!
Brilliant Martin, brilliant. Once again youve wrecked the grading curve. Oh, I pity the poor student who has to follow you. Bart Simpson? Youre next.	The Inventor I Admire, by Bart Simpson. The inventor I admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. Hes my father, Homer Simpson, creator of... the Flaming Homer!
Yes, everyone knows that.	Its not true! My father invented that drink, and if youll allow me to demonstrate...
Bart, are those liquor bottles?	I brought enough for everybody.
Take that off this second!	Okay.
Flaming Moes.	Uh, yes, Im looking for a friend of mine. Last name Jass, first name Hugh.
Hello, this is Hugh Jass.	Uh... hi.
Whos this?	Bart Simpson.
What can I do for you, Bart?	Uh, look. Ill level with you, mister. This is a crank call that sorta backfired and Id like to bail out right now.
Bart, are you going to moe the lawn today?	Okay, but you promised me moe money.
Your fathers stock is worth fifty-two hundred dollars!	Wow, fifty-two hundred smackers.
Its the miracle weve been waiting for.	What are we going to spend it on?
Ow!	Come on everybody. It makes you feel better.
There.	Yo, Homer. You gotta get ready for work.
Thats very clever.	And today, instead of buying comic books, I just read em and left em in the store.
Thats good, Lisa.	I didnt take a bath today and I may not take one tomorrow.
Moes Tavern. Moe speaking.	Uh yes, Im looking for a Mrs. OProblem. First name... Bee.
If it isnt little Bart Simpson! I havent seen you in years.	Thats right. Thats my pop!
Bet you get into all kinds of trouble he dont even know about. Am I right? Huh? Am I right?	Yeah, well, I make some crank phone calls.
Thats great! Hey, would you sing that old song you used to sing for me?	Moe, for you... anything?
Good heavens, Smithers! Theyre not afraid of me anymore!	Hey Mr. Burns, did you get that letter I sent?
Letter? I dont recall any letter...	Thats because I forgot to stamp it.
Well, Ill let you know.	Hey, Homer, how come Moms going to the doctor?
What?	I smell a bun in the oven.
Maybe.	Youre a machine, Homer.
Did you hear that Maggie? Another baby in the house.	Ohhh, cool, we can race them.
Yeah, but I have to hear about it.	Were you like this when Mom was pregnant with me?
Hey, youre supposed to be listening to my story!	I thought it was over. You had a problem turning a blade, you overcame it. The feel-good story of the year.
Dad, if the new baby is a girl, can we name her Ariel?	Im sorry, the babys name will be Kool Moe Dee Simpson.
Ariel.	Kool Moe Dee.
Ariel.	Kool Moe Dee.
Ariel.	Kool Moe Dee.
Oh, cmon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldnt be here today if I hadnt become the responsible head of a household.	Hey Homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?
Hey kids, while Sideshow Mel mops up, lets see the names of our Krusty birthday pals for today!	All right! Here comes my name!
All right! Here comes my name!	Wow, best eight bucks I ever spent.
Bart, your Grampas on the phone. He wants to wish you a happy birthday.	Isnt that nice? Take a message. Right now Im off to hit forty-six local merchants for free birthday goods and services.
Hey, later, okay... hey, why dont you go bug your parents?	Cool, Larry the Looter!
Hey there, I hear its your birthday. How old are you?	Well, Im --
Thats great! Would you like us to sing you a special song?	Hell, no.
Mmm-hmm. We have one at home. Before we got it I was always finding Pattys stubble in my leg razor.	Ehhh...
Bart, Ill bet you think nothins gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present!	Next.
Bart! Be polite.	Next, please.
Hey boy, hows the microphone working?	Fine.
Bart! I would love to get a present like that.	Here you go. Enjoy.
What a crappy birthday.	What do you mean, how did I get on the radio? I created the universe! Stupid kids.
Testing... testing... One, two, three... Oh, my. Do I sound like that?	Hey, it does work!
I bet you could have a lot of fun with this. Why dont you go show your father?	Hmmm.
Mmmmm. Chocolate.	People of Earth, this is Bartron, commander of the Martian invasion force. Your planet is in our hands. Resistance is useless.
Wait a minute. Does this mean you like my present?	Uh-huh.
Just promise me you wont play anymore practical jokes.	I promise.
I promise.	Mama! Mama!
Maggie! You talked! Can you say mama again?	Sorry lady, shows over.
I dreamed I was married to Corey, and we lived on a pony farm...and Corey was always walking around with his shirt off.	Oh, brotherrr.
Forgive my brother. We believe you.	Talk is cheap. Perhaps a test of thy faith. Walk through the wall. I will remove it for you...later.
What do you want from us?	I got a job for thee. Bring forth all the cookies from your kitchen and leave them on the Simpsons porch.
But those cookies belong to our parents.	Look, do you want a happy God or a vengeful God?
Happy God.	Then quit flapping your lip and make with the cookies.
Whoops!	Help! Help!
Hoot mon! Sounds like trouble a-brewin at the old well.	Help me, please! I fell down the well!
Out of my way! Look out, you horses arse!	Sucker.
Some fool kid fell down a well.	Yes!
Timmy, where are your parents?	Uh... I have no family. I tried to enroll in school, but your Principal Skinner turned me away because of my shabby clothes.
Awww.	Drop that microphone! Drop it, boy!
Bart!	I was trying to gnaw my foot off, but I couldnt get through my sock. Goodnight everybody.
Bart Simpson! The thought of a boy trapped in a well brought out the kindness and love of the entire community. When they find out youve been fooling them, theyre gonna want to cut you up with rusty razors.	Oh yeah? And how are they gonna find out?
The police will catch you sooner or later.	The police. They couldnt catch a cold.
What did I do to deserve this?	Help! Help! I fell down the well.
Tell us something we dont know.	No! My name is Bart Simpson!
What are you doing down there?	Look, Ill level with you. There is no Timmy OToole. It was just a prank I was playing on everybody.
Good one, Eddie.	Great joke, guys. Ha ha. Ha. Guys?
Dont worry, son. Just cause youre trapped in a hole doesnt mean you cant live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll...	Ow! Knock it off you bald boob!
Hey, dont make me come down there!	Like to see you fit.
Back in the hole!	No!
Bart? Honey, I made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while youre down in the well.	Mom, its too big.
Homer!	You know, Ive done a lot of bad stuff through the years. I guess now Im paying the price. But theres so many things Ill never get a chance to do. Smoke a cigarette, use a fake I.D., shave a swear word in my hair...
Shh! Marge, hes a good digger.	Sting!
Sting!	Mom! Dad!
Oh Bart, Ive missed you so much.	Man, I was so scared.
Bart!	Whaaat?
Bart?	Yeah mom?
I was thinking that while your father and Lisa watch the game, it might be fun if the two of us went clothes shopping.	Mom, Id love to. But to be honest, I dont need new clothes.
Hmm...	So even though Id love to spend this sunny afternoon trying on clothes. Its not...
Now Bart, I think youd look very sharp in this shirt.	Fine, get it. Lets go.
Oooh, and this ones fifty percent off.	You know why these clothes are on sale, Mom? Because the people who wear them get beaten up.
And dont make that face at me.	Howd ya know?
Bart?	In here, Mom. But dont open the--
Never heard that one before. Uh, would you care to select the wine?	Ill do the honors.
Ill do the honors.	No. No. No. No. My God, what passes for a wine list these days. Marco, just bring us your freshest bottle of wine. Chop. Chop.
Shut up. Shut up. Kiss my butt. Shut up. Go to Hell. Go to Hell.	Dad, I promise you I will never get tired of this.
Go to hell! Go to hell!	Hey, once again. Great present, Dad.
Bart, whos winning?	You hate dad is up by a touchdown.
There you go, Lisa. No pimentos. Bart, your hats where you left it, behind the toilet. Homer, Ill sew your pants but Im out of bologna.	Thanks mom.
No way.	Never happen.
Never happen.	Well, Ill be damned.
Mom, Barts making faces at me.	Its a nervous twitch and Im a little sensitive about it if you dont mind.
Barts making faces.	Wheres my lucky red cap?
Lisa, youll sleep in my bed. Bart, youll be sleeping with your Aunt Patty.	In your bed?
Move, Divorce Courts on in fifteen minutes.	Im scared, Lisa.
You think you know fear? Well, Ive seen them naked.	Aaah!
Bart you really shouldnt be looking through other peoples things. Find anything good?	Ive said it before and Ill say it again... Aye carumba!
Ive said it before and Ill say it again... Aye carumba!	Hey, Lis -- Bang! Bang!
Ah, Bart! Thats a black-head gun!	Eew!
Now, boys and girls, lets welcome our special guest, Ted Carpenter from the Twirl King yo-yo company.	Mom, I think I speak for everyone in this bed when I say you have nothing to worry about. Now lets just try and get a little shut eye, okay?
And many things made of zinc.	Gross, hes picking his nose!
The Cobra!	Those guys must be millionaires!
Oh.	How much do those yo-yos cost?
No. Heres my trick!	Thank you. Thank you.
No, they did not have yo-yos. Thats it. I am sick and tired of talking about yo-yos. From now on I will not accept any book reports, science projects, dioramas, or anything else on yo-yos or yo-yo related topics. Am I making myself clear?	Yo.
Hey Bart, got any new tricks for us today?	Just one. A little something I call Plucking the Pickle.
Just one. A little something I call Plucking the Pickle.	I build up a little steam, and...
I build up a little steam, and...	I didnt do it.
Bart, thats one months detention.	Mrs. Krabappel, were all upset by the untimely deaths of Stinky and Wrinkles. But life goes on. So, if I could just have my yo-yo back...
Bart, if I were you, and you were me, would you give back the yo-yo?	Here you go... Just kidding. Here you go... Just kidding.
Well, would you?	Absolutely.
Is it that girl with the lazy eye patch?	One months detention... Shell pay for this. Yup, theres your problem... someone jammed a Malibu Stacy head down here.
Just a sec.	Huh. One plus one equals two? Recently divorced fourth-grade teacher wishes to meet man age 18-60. Object save me. Write Edna K, Box 402.
Huh. One plus one equals two? Recently divorced fourth-grade teacher wishes to meet man age 18-60. Object save me. Write Edna K, Box 402.	Hmmm.
Hmmm.	Dear Edna, Ive never answered a personal ad before, but I found yours irresistible. My name is...
How was detention today, dear?	Oh, not bad. Im starting to get the hang of the floor waxer.
Oh, not bad. Im starting to get the hang of the floor waxer.	Yes!
Dear Woodrow, I must admit Im intrigued. Youre not like the other men Ive met.	Yeah. Im the 28th President of the United States.
Mmm! Could it be theres a special someone youre not telling me about?	Oh, please.
But Ive had some bad experiences with these ads. So, Id like to learn more about you. Please write back soon. Heres a photo thatll get your pencil moving.	Youve got a date with a xerox machine.
Yeah?	Suppose I was writing a second letter to a girl and I already used up my A material. What should I say?
Is it that exchange student Mx!pa?	No! Its not for me. Its homework.
Maybe its the beer talking, Marge, but youve got a butt that wont quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here.	Wow, a side of dad Ive never seen.
I was just thinking... oh, you wouldnt be interested.	Try me. Sometimes it helps to talk.
Well, I was just wishing I could meet a man who... likes the way I look first thing in the morning... laughs at my jokes...	Uh-huh.
...can fix my car...	Oh yeah.
Ah, my love... A million poets could try for a million years and still describe but three-eighths of your beauty.	Ohhh, slow down, Frenchy! This stuff is gold.
Dear Woodrow, its time for us to meet. Why dont we go out to dinner and afterward we can go to my apartment for some home cookin.	Huh? Aye carumba!
...Hungrily yours, Edna.	Well, shes dangled on the line long enough. Its time to boat this bass.
Bart! Eyes down.	Yes, maam.
Yes, maam.	Edna, every second until we meet stabs me like a thousand needles...
I cant help but feel partly responsible.	Homer, that was a twenty.
Oh, Woodrow. How could you stand me up?	Mrs. K, whoever this guy is, you dont need him. There are plenty of good men around.
Name one.	Whats wrong with Principal Skinner?
Seymour? Huh, lets just say his mommy wont let him out to play.	What about Coach Fortner?
Glug, glug, glug, glug...	Wow! What about Groundskeeper Willie?
Theres Maggie!	Mom, this is a little ahead of schedule, but I need help with my love life.
I knew it. All right, Bart, whos your girlfriend?	Mrs. Krabappel.
Though Ill be inoculating babies in Kampuchea, my heart will always be with you.	That sucks. How bout, Crocodiles bit off my face.
Okay, okay... I cannot see you for the next five years, for I will be farming the ocean floor.	I must finish this letter quickly, for I have only four minutes to live.
Oh, thats sweet.	Ohhh, Homer, you old honey dripper.
Bart, its such a nice day today. Lets have detention outside.	Its a date.
Come here boy, I want to show you something.	Whats that? A home-made bat?
And here it is.	Wow! How many home runs you gonna hit with that?
And the next man wants to hit the ball too. And he does. And there he goes off in that direction. And everyone is happy.	Uh, Mom, why dont you let me call the game.
Wow, Dad.	Homer, can I get you a beer?
Marge, forget it. Hes bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do.	You make me sick Homer. Youre the one who told me I could do anything if I just put my mind to it.
Well now that youre a little bit older, I can tell you thats a crock. No matter how good you are at something, theres always about a million people better than you.	Gotcha. Cant win, dont try.
I pick Ken Griffey Jr.	Aw geez... okay, Ill take Milhouse.
You got yourself a player.	Damn! All right, Ill take Lewis.
No, no, no! I dont want you to see me sitting on my butt.	Weve seen it, dad.
You stink Strawberry. We want Home-run Homer!	Dar-ryl, Dar-ryl.
Children, tell me when your father stops scratching himself. Kids?	Well tell ya, mom.
Mm, hmm. Its like a Mommy.	Police officer? Well, Ill be jiggered.
If youd like to learn more I could arrange for you to ride along in a police car for a night.	Hey, I dont need you to get me in the back of a police car.
I really think you should consider this. You know, before I saw these test results I had you pegged as a drifter.	Wow, a drifter.
So whatre you gonna be, boy?	Policeman.
Good for you. Maybe thisll straighten the boy out.	Wow! Can I see your club?
Its called a baton, son.	Oh, whats it for?
Hey Bart, you see that Caddy over there?	Huh-huh.
Do you need straight As to be a cop?	Hey, fellas, lets go shoot some bad guys.
I dont know. Son, this is against every regulation, but would you cover us?	Woww!
They can still hear things!	Sir, I know what I wanna be when I grow up. A cop!
Now, just relax your hand.	Thank you, Maam. Youve been most cooperative.
Bad dog! Very bad dog.	Mom, before you blame the dog, I think you should take a look at these surveillance photos.
Oh... Oh... Unng... Oh, Bart.	Uh, I dont know how that got in there.
Okay, but if you really want to honk Skinner off, I suggest you attack the one thing he truly believes in.	Really?
Think youre big men with your handcuffs and blasted tasers!	Get him outta here.
Now what is this all about?	Well, its quite simple, really. I observed our friend Groundskeeper Willie burning leaves with a blatant disregard for our clean air laws.
Bart Simpson on the side of law and order? Has the world gone topsy-turvy?	Thats right, man. I got my first taste of authority... And I liked it.
Bart, there are a lot of troublemakers in this school... and Lord knows I cant be everywhere at once.	Go on.
Look, lets can the euphemisms, huh? No more bullspit. How would you like to be a hall monitor?	Wouldnt that mean squealing on other kids?
Thats the meat of it, yes.	Hmm.
Aye carumba!	Uh, I dont know.
Oooh, now, you get to wear a sash...	Youve got yourself a narc.
Hey, Jimbo, keepin your nose clean, dude? Attaboy! Hey, Donna, who loves ya, baby?	Not in my hall, bub.
Did you say one hundred and thirty million dollars?	I think youve had enough, sister. Cmon, lets keep it moving.
Pink belly! Pink belly! Pink belly!	Allright, break it up, boys. That belly aint gonna get any pinker.
Bart, youre doing a bang-up job. You know, before there were some corridors of this school youd just never go down. Now I feel safe anywhere.	Every day is a new fight, sir.
Now, to show my gratitude, I want you to help yourself to an item of your choice.	All-riight!
Ooo, now, you be careful with that crossbow.	I will.
I will.	Seymour, this is an absent slip signed by Nelsons mother. And this is Nelsons English homework. Notice the identical elongated loops on the ds.
Ow! Bart, do something.	Lets go, Milhouse.
Were going to have to re-order every book.	Seymour, Ill bet you a steak dinner those books are still here. All we have to do is search every locker.
Oh, Bart, Im not sure random locker searches are permitted by the Supreme Court...	Pfft, Supreme Court. What have they done for us lately?
Thats right. It was I.	Lis, why did you do it?
Lis, why did you do it?	Yeah, but even I had my limits. Youre looking at expulsion for this.
Oh, answers! Answers! Simpson, youve just saved the school one hundred and twenty dollars. Whos behind this monstrous crime?	I am.
Ive been so blind. In retrospect, the signs all pointed to a rogue hall monitor.	Sorry if I betrayed your trust, Principal Sucker.
Doh. Now Bart, in light of your recent service to the school, Ive decided to be lenient. Four hundred days detention.	Four hundred days. I can do that standing on my head.
All right, five hundred days.	Oooh, big man.
Six hundred days.	Maybe Ill just shut my big mouth.
Bart, whyd you take the blame?	Cause I didnt want you to wreck your life. You got the brains and the talent to go as far as you want. And when you do, Ill be right there to borrow money.
Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?	Put it in the bank.
What do kids know about spending money?	What are you gonna do, Homer?
Well... I guess well have to talk it over.	Talk what over? Whats there to talk about?
Talk what over? Whats there to talk about?	What are we going to talk over?
In Doggie Heaven, theres mountains of bones and they cant turn around without sniffing another dogs butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and...	Is there a Doggie Hell?
Well... of course. There couldnt be a heaven if there werent a hell.	Whos in there?
Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy.	Hey! Wait a minute, does this have anything to do with Santas Little Helper?
Oh, honey. Seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. We really cant afford this operation.	Youre gonna just let him die?
I know youre upset --	Darn right Im upset!
Bart, watch your language. Oh. You did. Sorry.	We are not going to let our dog die! And thats IT! Lousy dog-killing sonsa...
Bart, from now on youll have to get your hair cut for free at Springfield Barber College.	No problemo.
Cant you see Im reading a third-rate biography of Copernicus I found at the bus station?	Dumb dog.
Bart! Close the gate.	Lisa! Close the gate.
Here Santas Little Helper!	Its all my fault. I called him a dumb dog.
Or... to put it another way... there is.	Im not giving up. I dont care if I have to knock on every door in this two-bit town. Im gonna find my dog.
Hello, Im Kent Brockman.	Um, excuse me sir, I lost my dog.
Hmm huh. And I suppose you want me to buy you a new one. You know, ever since I won the lottery, everybody wants a piece of Kent Brockman. Homeless this, and hungry that.	Gee, Im sorry mister.
Release the hounds.	Santas Little Helper! Its you! AAAGGGHHH!!
Santas Little Helper! Its you! AAAGGGHHH!!	Whats the matter boy? Dont you know me? Im your buddy!
Whats the matter boy? Dont you know me? Im your buddy!	I love ya, boy.
So, what are we going to see?	Ernest Cuts The Cheese!
Just tell me when the scary parts over.	Its over.
Homer, if it makes you feel any better, most of what they threw at you splattered on me. Homer?...	Forget it, mom. Dads really mad. The tendons are throbbing at the base of his neck...
Forget it, mom. Dads really mad. The tendons are throbbing at the base of his neck...	And stress is collecting in the trouble spots here... here... and here... Making for one unhappy pappy.
Shes wonderful. I could feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit.	Country music sucks. All it does is take precious air space away from shock DJs whose cruelty and profanity amuse us all.
OH THE BASES WERE EMPTY ON THE DIAMOND OF MY HEART/ WHEN THE COACH CALLED ME UP TO THE PLATE/ ID BEEN SWINGIN AND MISSIN AND LOVIN AND KISSIN/ MY AVERAGE WAS POINT DOUBLE AUGHT EIGHT/ SO I SPIT ON MY HANDS/ KNOCKED THE DIRT FROM MY SPIKES/ AND POINTED RIGHT TOWARD CENTER FIELD/ THIS TIME IM HITTIN A HOME RUN/ THIS TIME LOVE IS FOR REAL/ ILL SLIDE, ILL STEAL,	Hey Dad, can I do a ham-bone solo?
Uh... I gotta go.	As much as I hate that man right now, you gotta love that suit.
Look Maggie, they have a baby, too.	Its like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen.
Ooooh.	Bleuh.
You see, Aunt Selma has this crazy obsession about not dying alone, so in desperation, she joined this prison pen-pal program. Her new sweeties a jailbird.	Cool, he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunch tray.
You see, Bart here is the Shamus in short pants who sent me to prison.	Thats right, Aunt Selma. Your new boyfriend here framed Krusty the Clown for armed robbery.
White.	Knock it off.
Yes, I hope the police are saying that as well.	I cant believe you guys. This man framed Krusty the Clown.
Hey, if they ever open the books on this telethon, Im right back in there.	That Sideshow Bob is a no-good showbiz phony.
There, there...	Oh well, I guess the weddings off. Fiddle dee dee, tomorrows another day.
Oh Bob.	Bart no like. Bad medicine.
I couldve been the flower girl. And I wouldnt keep falling down either.	Hey, they chose Maggie, okay?
Why Selma dear, youll bury us all.	Chief Wiggum, youve been around. You dont trust Sideshow Bob, do you?
And make love?	Why would Sideshow Bob go so nuts over a fireplace?
Because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.	Romantic? With Aunt Selma?
Tonight on MacGyver...	Aunt Selma has one hour to live!
Poor Selma, you were having such a lovely evening AND THEN I WENT AND SPOILED IT ALL BY DOING SOMETHING STUPID LIKE EXPLODE YOU.	Sideshow Bob, Im afraid the only victims here are the good people at Best Western Hotels.
My best laid plans have gang aglay!	Chief Wiggum, think you have room in your jail for a two-time loser?
Yeah, Bart. Fill us in.	Well, Id hate to tell the number one cop in town how to do his job.
No, no, please. Its the only way Ill learn.	All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas.
All right. Sideshow Bob seemed so desperate to get that fireplace. But why? Then it hit me -- the gas.	Surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except Aunt Selma.
I permanently lost my sense of taste and smell.	She happily watched her MacGyver, unaware that her room was silently filling with natural gas. All it needed to explode was a single spark... say, from a cigarette...
Her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.	Dad, when Aunt Selma lights up her cigarette at the end of MacGyver, shell be blown to kingdom come!
Come again?	After trying four times to explain it to Homer, I explained it to Mom and we were on our way.
Well, he fooled almost everyone. But there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust.	Thanks, Mom. Now. Lets get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate.
... Yeah... Lets play the tape.	Hey Milhouse, cool jacket!
Now, just meet me back here after the show.	Thanks, Dad. Sure youre not gonna be bored?
Test... test...	Gee, Im sorry, man.
Huh?	About the frisbee.
I just looked out, and theres puddles of water all over the freakin stage!	I said slag off!
All riiiight! This morning we were driving down... Route 401...	Thats only four miles from my house!
They were only on for twenty minutes!	What a gyp!
Of course, it would be wrong to suggest that this sort of mayhem began with rock and roll. After all, there were riots at the premiere of Mozarts The Magic Flute. So whats the answer? Ban all music? In this reporters opinion the answer, sadly, is yes.	Hi, Mom.
Oh, oh... thank God!	Mom, I want to be a rock star.
This is real.	Wow!
Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him.	Id like to play me latest chart-topper. Its called Me Fans Are Stupid Pigs.
Bart, youve got to go on.	Slag off!
Hey, Simpson, what are you trying to play?	Polly Wolly Doodle.
Hey, cherry axe, Bart-dude.	I think its broken.
Oh, really? Give it here.	I didnt know you played the guitar, Otto-man!
Perhaps youd like to try an experimental flavor of my own concoction. A delicious Chutney-Squishee.	Uh... okay.
You can really taste the chutney.	Uggh...
Ow!	Otto-man?
Otto-man?	Youre living in a dumpster?
Oh, man, I wish. Dumpster brand trash bins are top of the line. This is just a Trash-Co waste disposal unit.	Otto, why dont you come home with me? You can stay in our garage.
Bart, whats going on?	Mom, I thought you might forget our little conversation this afternoon, so I took the precaution of recording it.
What conversation?	Mom, can Otto live in our garage for as long as he wants? He sure can!
Forget it. That line didnt work for my dad and its not gonna work for you.	Dad, Ottos going through a real tough time. Cant he stay with us for awhile?
Yes, but doesnt the Bible also say, Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut?	Please, Dad. If you let Otto stay, hell help around the house, and chip in a few bucks whenever he can.
Thats better. Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?	Ill tell you the truth, Dad. I wasnt good at it right away, so I quit. I hope youre not mad.
Ill tell you the truth, Dad. I wasnt good at it right away, so I quit. I hope youre not mad.	You can do it, Otto. Youre the coolest adult I ever met.
Son, come here. Heh, heh, heh. Of course Im not mad. If somethings hard to do, then its not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and well go inside and watch TV.	Whats on?
Heavy.	What are you going to do, Otto?
I dont know about this Bart dude. Your dad is right, I am a bum.	He didnt call you a bum, he called you a sponge.
Hey, Bart, look at this. My dad took me to Circus of Values last night and said I could get anything I wanted.	Cool! An oversized novelty billiard ball.
Yeah, you shake it up and it tells the future.	Will I pass my English test?
Will I pass my English test?	Outlook not so good. Wow! It does work!
That ball knows everything.	Hey, I got a good one. Will Milhouse and I be friends till were toothless old men with hair coming out of our ears? READING BALL, SURPRISED) Dont count on it. Will Milhouse and I be friends when were high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? It looks doubtful. Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day?
Hey, I got a good one. Will Milhouse and I be friends till were toothless old men with hair coming out of our ears? READING BALL, SURPRISED) Dont count on it. Will Milhouse and I be friends when were high school dropouts living off Uncle Sucker? It looks doubtful. Will Milhouse and I be friends at the end of the day?	What could come between two bestest buddies like us?
Hey Bart, was this thing right about your test?	To those who doubt the power of the Magic 8-Ball, I say Behold my F!
Itll take you about six weeks, dear.	Hey, Milhouse, would you like a wet willie?
Eew!	Victim number four. Hey, Lewis, can I interest you in a wet willie?
Oh, dont you worry. Most of you will never fall in love and marry out of fear of dying alone.	How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature?
Im sorry, that would be playing God.	God shmod, I want my monkey-man.
Everybody on, but no shoving. Just kiddin, you can shove all you want.	Hey, wait Otto-man, you cant leave. Milhouse isnt here yet.
Hey, Bart.	Milhouse, what a pleasant surprise.
Hi.	Hey, whats with the skirt?
Ive brought friends to this treehouse before.	Yeah, but never a girl. What if I want to strut around nude?
Got any girl comics? Like Bonnie Craine, Girl Attorney, Punkin & Duncan, the Twinkle Twins, or Lil Kneesocks?	No, but my sisters got a wide selection of crappy comics.
No, but my sisters got a wide selection of crappy comics.	you guys wanna see something gross?
Okay, Milhouse... Ill trade your Carl Yastrzemski baseball card for my Omar Vizquel.	Deal! Next on the trading block, your Mickey Mantle -- 1958, mint condition -- for my picture of Homer on the couch.
Bart, its not just the kissing. A lot of it is waitin to kiss. You know like when you open an Eskimo Pie and you wait just a little bit for it to melt?	But she doesnt melt.
Dont you usually play with Milhouse after school?	He has a girlfriend.
Milhouse?	Yeah, all they do is kiss.
Bart? This is the first time anyone has ever sat next to me since I successfully lobbied to have the school day extended by twenty minutes.	Listen Martin, right now Im looking for a friend who wont leave me for a girl.
Thats me. Im just as unpopular with the ladies as I am with the chaps.	Yeah, right. Anyway... do you want to do something after school?
Now Bart, would you care to listen to me play the lute?	Uh, sure.
Listen, Bart... theres such a thing as spendin too much time together.	Oh. Fine. Im tired of watching you two lip wrestle. Theres plenty of other ways to be grossed out in this town.
Bart, wait!	Yeah?
Uh... can we still use your tree house?	What? Get bent.
If her father catches us -- hell kill her.	All right, Milhouse. You can use my tree house.
Thanks, Bart.	Samantha and Milhouse sitting in a tree, about to lose their pri-va-cy!
Ooh...a sextet of ale.	Hello, Mr. Stanky... I have some shocking news about your daughter Samantha... Who am I? Lets just say Im a concerned prude with a lot of time on his hands.
Samantha!	Well Milhouse, Tis better to have loved and lost... yada yada yada... lets go to the arcade.
Hey Bart, according to this magazine, in another million years, man will have an extra finger.	Five fingers? Ew, freak show. Listen, Lis. I need some advice and moms not here.
Why didnt you go to dad?	I did, but I couldnt understand what the hell he was saying. Lisa, I feel terrible. I ratted on my best friend and he doesnt even know I did it.
Bart, Im glad youre here. Milhouse could use a friend like you.	Yeah.
Bart, I didnt want you to see me cry.	Oh, come on, Ive seen you cry a million times. You cry when you scrape your knee. You cry when theyre out of chocolate milk. You cry when youre doing long division and you have a remainder left over.
Whoa, its a miracle!	Boy, I bet the 8-ball didnt see that one comin.
I cant stop thinking about her. Even these gates remind me of her braces.	How are we going to find her?
Samantha, I went to Circus of Values to buy you a ten gallon tub of Gummy Bears.	Hey Samantha, Im sorry about gettin you thrown in the penguin house.
Bart, think I can ever find another one like her?	Youre asking the wrong guy, Milhouse. They all look alike to me. Now lets go whip donuts at old people
Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this?	We were just sitting on the couch, quietly chatting, when we heard a creaking noise.
We leapt off just in time to see it collapse.	There, there. Youre safe now, little sister.
This Award is the biggest farce I ever saw.	What about the Emmys?
They do good work.	Unky Herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?
Maybe we should play another game.	Why are we playin games when we got two grand in the bank!? Remember when Dad won the First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence?
That was your idea.	I think we should get a machine gun. We could use it to hunt game, spell out things, or ring in the new year!
I think we owe a debt to Unky Herb. He took us into his home and Dad destroyed him.	Dad, you know some shysters gonna bilk you out of your money. It may as well be your brother.
Now, I bet youre all wondering what lies under this sheet.	Not really. We peeked inside while you were in the john.
Now Bart, I know youre too young for the machine gun you wanted. But Im gonna give you something thatll make sure when youre old enough you can still buy one. A membership in the National Rifle Association.	Wow! The NRA. Can I be get armor piercing cyanide-tipped bullets, too?
Here are your grades.	Oh no, Mrs. Krabappel. If I dont get a C average, my Dad wont let me go to Kamp Krusty.
Well, it isnt fair to the other children, but, all right.	Much obliged, doll.
Somebody put a torch to these permanent records! Quickly now.	La-la-la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la. La-la-la-la-la. La-la-...
Wake up, boy.	Oh, I dreamt it was the last day of school.
Well it is.	Oh how do I know this isnt some beautiful dream, too?
Oh how do I know this isnt some beautiful dream, too?	You know, a pinch is more traditional.
No, Dad. You promised if Bart and I got C averages we could go to Kamp Krusty. And with no false modesty, youre looking at one happy camper.	Yeah. Well, just remember when you see my report card they got this whole new grading system this year. It now goes D,B,A,C.
Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and youd better keep your end of it. I dont think Id be any kind of a father if you got Ds and I let you go to Kamp Krusty.	But Dad...
Attention students please clear out your lockers into the waste baskets provided.	36-24-36...
36-24-36...	Now lets see what we got here.
Now lets see what we got here.	Ah, my gym shorts.
Bart, wheres your bathing suit?	Im gonna swim nekkid.
Duly noted.	Id also like to add as I gaze upon your beauty, Ive never seen an angel fly so low.
Forget it, short pants.	Mrs. Krabappel, if I dont get at least a C average I cant go to Kamp Krusty.
So, Bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of Kamp Krusty?	You bet. Check out this hand. All aces!
And the best part is when you come to Kamp Krusty, youll spend the summer with me. Honest Injun!	Well, here goes nothin.
Stupid roller-skate.	Well, dad, heres my report card. I think youll be pleasantly surprised.
A+? You dont think much of me, do you boy?	No, sir.
You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy.	So I wont get to go to camp?
Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didnt. But why should you pay for my mistake?	You mean I can go?
Yeah. I didnt want you hangin around all summer anyway.	Oh, Dad. Youre the best father a boy could ever have!
Thanks son. Now, youve got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?	Ah sure, therell be a couple of uptight counselors who wont dig the Bart philosophy, but I feel the human body is a thing of beauty.
Oh, Im going to miss this.	Hey, hands off my pickle.
I dont see your name on it, boy.	No, but...
Check... mate.	Always thinking two moves ahead.
Ill write you every day.	Dont look in my closet. In fact, stay out of my room all together.
No. Last question.	When do we get to see Krusty?
This is a little more rustic than I expected.	Im not worried, Lis. You know why? Because of this...
Im not worried, Lis. You know why? Because of this...	The Krusty Brand seal of approval. You can only find it on products which meet the high personal standards of Krusty the Clown.
I feel like Im gonna die, Bart.	Were all gonna die, Lis.
I meant soon.	So did I.
Bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that Krusty the clown will come through.	Krusty is coming. Krusty is coming. Krusty is coming.
Well kids, uh, I promised you a little treat in lieu of dinner and here it is. The man who took an abandoned mule tannery and turned it into a summer wonderland, Mr. Krusty the Clown.	See, I told you Krusty would come. Just like I said, heh, heh. Hes gonna bring us food and water and smite our enemies.
Tijuana!	Thats not Krusty the Clown.
Bart, you said you were gonna name it Camp Freedom.	Ehh, this has more zing.
I dont know her name, but she held up a liquor store last year.	I smell bacon. Lets see if hes wearing a wire.
Well, at least youre not as bad as customs.	How could you, Krusty? Id never lend my name to an inferior product.
They drove a dump truck full of money up to my house. Im not made of stone!	Krusty, this camp was a nightmare. They fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear.
Oh my God.	Well actually, the bear just ate his hat.
Was it a nice hat?	Oh yeah.
Yuh huh.	Doh-kay.
Memo to Goldie Hawn Cheerleading tryouts were thirty years ago. Lets grow up, shall we?	Hes such a bitch.
Kids, back me up.	Hes right, mom.
Wow! My mother the actress. I feel like Lucie Arnaz-Luckinbill.	Are there any jive-talking robots in this play?
It maght.	An oill talk like is. Bobs yer uncle, mate.
Big Daddy, would yall mind passin a lil ol biscuit?	Can I slog off school tomorrow? Got a pain in me gulliver.
STELLA! STELLLA! CANT YOU HEAR ME YELL-A? / YOURE PUTTIN ME THROUGH HELL-A / STELLA! STELLA!	Cool, she can fly!
Mom!	Way to go, mom.
Kids, wait in the car. I want to talk to your mother about this play thing.	Lookin for a spot of fun with the missus, eh guvnor?
Your father is... resting.	Resting hung over, resting got fired..? Help me out here.
The searing heat... the scalding rivers of molten sulfur...	Ahhh... Im there.
Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed by thy...	Lisa, this is neither the time nor the place.
Please, Christians, dont push.	Excuse me... pardon me... whoop... comin through... how ya doin?... love that hat, baby...
Hey, whats the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isnt God everywhere?	Amen, brother.
And dont you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?	Tell it, daddy!
And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week were just making God madder and madder.	Testify!
Lets go, kids.	How come we have to go to church and Dad gets to stay home and watch cartoons?
My friends, the devil walks among us.	Ooop, I got him.
Thats right, old friend.	Dad!
Haw haw!	Pick the red, get ahead, pick the black, set you back.
I dont recall authorizing this booth.	Goodbye, gentlemen.
Oh.	Hey, Otto-man. I dare you to make this go faster.
Uh-huh.	Oh baby!
Oh baby!	Uh-oh.
But I think shell win.	Dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? Hubba, hubba.
Oh. Well, yes, thats what I meant, too. Well, tell you what. This afternoon, Ill take you to the beauty parlor and show you just how lovely you can be.	And later Ill teach you the tricks of the trade taping your swimsuit to your butt, petroleum jelly on your teeth for that frictionless smile, and the ancient art of padding .
Boy, when Lisa comes in, I want you to make a big fuss over how she looks.	Shell see through me like Grandmas underpants.
No, she wont. When it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin more, MORE! MORE! And if you give it to em, youll get plenty back in return.	Like what?
Is that Lisa? Ooh, I gotta call heaven -- theres an angel missing!	And whos your little school friend? Wait a minute, thats Mom!
Hey... hey!	Whooo! Whooo! Dad, do you know anything else about women?
Hey brush head, youve been nursing that thing for an hour.	You know, I was just wondering how someone who works in an ice cream store keeps such a trim figure.
And the winner is... Lisa Simpson!	Okay, wipe away a tear... ... hug the loser...
Okay, wipe away a tear... ... hug the loser...	And now for your triumphant walk down the runway.
Its hopeless.	Theres nothing to it. Give me those heels.
Theres nothing to it. Give me those heels.	Heel -- toe. Heel -- toe. Heel -- toe.
Do you really think I can win?	Hey, Im starting to think I can win.
But those other girls are prettier than me.	Lis, as your brother, this is the hardest thing Ive ever had to say. Youre not ugly.
Id say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod. Unless its made out of plastic.	Nope. Metal.
The government. I didnt earn it. I dont need it. But if they miss one payment, Ill raise hell.	Hey Homer - wheres your present?
Happy birthday, son!	Great Caesars Ghost! A talking Krusty doll!
Im Krusty the Clown and I love you very much.	Oh, Dad, this is the best birthday Ive ever had.
That doll tried to kill me!	Id say that the pressures finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure?
... So then, his wife comes through the door!!!	So?
Well, she was. And she hit him in the head with a golf club!	And?
Homer, Ive coughed up scarier stuff than that.	Grampa, why dont you tell us a story? Youve led an interesting life.
Whoa!	Nice try, Mr. Flanders, but Ive got a story so scary youll wet your pants.
Bart, you mean to tell me you read a book intended for preschoolers?	Well, most of it.
Find Waldo Yet Again.	Man, hes just not tryin anymore. Gee, never noticed that before!
Man, hes just not tryin anymore. Gee, never noticed that before!	Whoa! Ow! Whats this?
Evil... Evil... Bad... Beware... Beware...	Cool.
Bart, please. Dont you remember that Snowball I died four years ago tonight? Run over by the Mayors beer swilling brother, Clovis.	Hey, maybe theres a spell in here thatll bring her back from the dead.
Hey, maybe theres a spell in here thatll bring her back from the dead.	Lets see what weve got... How to Get Your Skeletons Their Whitest... Selling Your Soul in a Buyers Market... Ah, here we are, How to Raise The Dead.
Cullen, Rayburn, Narz, Trebek!	Zabar, Kresge, Caldor, Walmart!
Bart! You cast the wrong spell! Zombies!	Please Lis, they prefer to be called the Living Impaired.
Did you wreck the car?	No.
Brains! Brains!	I thought dabbling in the black arts would be good for a chuckle. How wrong I was. I should have never read that book.
Hey Simpson, Im feeling a mite peckish. Mind if I chew your ear?	Dad, you killed the zombie Flanders!
Hurry, Bart!	Kolchak, Mannix, Banacek, Danno!
Whats wrong?	Uh, I never realized what a beautiful young woman youve become.
Ah.	Trojan, Ramses, Magnum, Sheik!
Well, Im sure glad we didnt turn into mindless zombies.	Shh! TV!
I dont have to sit here and take this. I... .	Hubba hubba! Oh you kid!
What if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad?	Poison pizza.
I did. I did read to her!	Im starving! Somebody bring me some food, quick!
Well, youve got to start being firm with him. I believe with persistent discipline even the poorest student can end up becoming... oh... say Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.	Yeah, right. Like youre gonna let me go hungry. Ill be eatin that pizza in five minutes.
Youre fat!	Just more of me to love, honey.
What? Whazzat?	Hi mom. Hi dad. Home already? Boy, time really flies when youre reading... The Bible? Ew.
Bart! Stop being confident.	There must be something to eat around here.
There must be something to eat around here.	Gee, maybe they mean it this time. From now on I guess Id better straighten up and fly...
Just promise me youll try to be good.	I promise.
Thataboy.	Sucker.
Bart!	Stick around, Mr. Bond. Things are really starting to cook.
If you want suspense...romance...youll find it in the Itchy & Scratchy Movie. Coming soon to a theater near you. 53% new footage.	Wow.
Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked?	Indeed I did.
Boy, youre going to have to be punished for this.	Dad, you could punish me. But that means youd have to think of a punishment, sit here and make sure I do it...
Bart! Why are you doing that?	Iunno.
Well, this time you must be punished.	Well, you could punish me, but...
Now, what were we talking about, boy?	Uh... we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
Bart, are you pulling up the carpet?	Yuh - huh.
All right. All right. Bart, go to your room.	See ya in the funny pages.
But first well examine the growing Itchy & Scratchy mania with their new movie premiering today!	I got my ticket.
Bart, didnt I ask you to watch Maggie?	Sounds like something youd say.
Sounds like something youd say.	Hey, where is she?
All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment Ive ever handed down. And this time its gonna stick!	Come on, Homer. This isnt funny.
Oh, nnnooo. Beta.	Dad, you gotta let me see that movie. Cant you just give me a spanking?
Dad, you gotta let me see that movie. Cant you just give me a spanking?	Come on, go nuts.
Someday youll thank me for this, son.	Not bloody likely.
No, its true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catchers mitt. But, my dad wouldnt get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage.	Dad, whats the point of this story?
I like stories.	Look, can I please go to the movie?
I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I cant go back on it. Youre welcome to watch anything you want on TV.	TV sucks.
The master craftsman can make three mailboxes an hour.	Im not licked yet. I can entertain myself. No matter how good a movie is, it cant compare to the imagination of a small boy.
It wasnt that great.	Be honest.
It was the greatest movie Ive ever seen in my life. And you wouldnt believe the celebrities who did cameos. Dustin Hoffman, Michael Jackson... of course they didnt use their real names, but you could tell it was them.	Lisa.
Ive seen it 17 times.	You guys must be gettin pretty tired of that movie by now.
Im here at the Springfield Aztec Theater where, after eight months and nine Academy Awards, the Itchy and Scratchy movie is showing for the last time. Tomorrow, a new movie, starring Liza Minnelli and Mickey Rourke will open. Will it be as successful? Only time will tell.	Well, Dad, I guess you won.
Well, Ill be. The Itchy and Scratchy Movie.	Come on. What dya say?
All right. I think youve learned your lesson.	One senior citizen and one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
Which ones the mouse?	Itchy.
Itchys a jerk.	Yeah.
... Leaving the Vice President in charge. And now, Leaning Tower of Pisa eat your heart out and move over! This is one story thats not on the level!	Behold the horrors of the Slanty Shanty. See the twisted creatures that dwell within. Meet Cue Ball, the man with no hair!
They discovered radium. Then they both died of radiation poisoning.	Hmmm!
Its the Curies. We must flee!	Cool!
Put away your books, children. Its time for your English test.	Sick... on test day... Why? Whyyy?
Bart, have you ever read The Boy Who Cried Wolf?	Im halfway through it, I swear!
Good news, boy. I found a pharmacy that carries leeches! Well, it wasnt exactly a pharmacy... more of a bait shop.	Look, Grampa, Im fine! I really dont need any more home remedies.
Oral thermometer, my eye! Think warm thoughts, boy, cause this is mighty cold.	Aaaagh!
So, Bart, how are you feeling?	Cant complain.
Well, then youre ready for your make up test.	Aagh! My ovaries!
Have you ever read The Boy Who Cried Wolf?	I glanced at it... boy cries wolf... has a few laughs... I forget how it ends.
Bart, is that light green?	Yeah.
Bart, to avoid this test youve had smallpox, the bends and that unfortunate bout of rabbies.	Well, Im not sure Im over it. Shove it, witch.
Bart, Im not even going to grade this until you tell me the truth about what happened out there.	The truth is, there was no wolf. I faked the whole thing. Im just going to lie on the floor now. Please dont let me swallow my tongue.
I dont think we should be down here.	Nervous, Lis? I dont blame you. This is where the Winfields hid their mutated son.
Bart! The Winfields didnt have a son.	See that sock over there? It was his only friend.
See that sock over there? It was his only friend.	Hello, Lisa. Here in the dark you wont need those eyes. Let me have them.
Bart, thats not funny.	There are some who say the monster... ... is still... here!
Hey kid, wake up.	Who are you?
Im Laura - your new neighbor. You all right?	I fell on my bottom.
I bet you dont know this one. Howd you like a Hertz Donut?	Oh.
...All you can eat, ha!	Uh, right. Do you know what a Wet Willie is?
Now, where were we? Oh yeah, I was gonna tell your fortune.	Huh?
Oh, man, youre gonna be rich!	Whoa!
Theres your mansion. Theres the tennis court... and theres the swimming pool! See you later, Bart!	Ill never wash this hand again.
No All You Can Eat Seafood. I wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. Nothing!	Maybe Laura could watch us.
Oh, I get it. Bart, the baby-sitters here. Let me tuck you in.	Silence!
Bart, are you taking a bath?	Yes I am. And it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change.
This wouldnt have anything to do with Laura coming over, would it?	Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest.
Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest.	Why, Laura. What a pleasant surprise.
I dont care. Ask Hef over there.	Ladys choice.
We used to eat this when my dad was stationed in Vandahar. Take your Kafta B-Sanieh and dip it in the Labneh.	Now that is good Labneh.
Just follow me. Put your hand on my hip.	O-kay.
Wedgie!	Whoa.
Oh no! Here comes the Conservative Judge!	Plead insanity! Plead insanity!
All right. Hit the change of venue button. Now!	Oh no. Youre in Texas!
I am thinking you like this girl, yes?	How did you know?
Here I am, sonny.	Youre not my Grampa.
Bart! Ah, you remembered my birthday.	Huh? Oh. I sure did!... Heres a bus schedule.
Wow! Fits right in my pocket!	Grampa, I need some advice. Did you ever have a crush on an older woman?
I had a crush on the oldest woman. One hundred and twenty years old, she was. Heres a picture of her delivering Eubie Blake.	What happened?
Maybe youre right. Now, if youll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father.	Dad, if theres a really special girl and she likes some clod whos beneath her, what should you do?
So I says, Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it cause I dont know where it is you baloney... You make me wanna retch...	How can I get her to notice me?
Thanks for coming.	I please to aim.
I really think youd like him, Bart. His names Jimbo.	Jimbo Jones?
Very well, Ill continue to wait.	How can you like that guy?
I dont know. Maybe cause hes an outlaw. You know that dead body they found behind the mayors house?	Jimbo killed him?
Leave him alone, hes just a kid.	Ill show them whos just a kid.
All right you guys, I want you in bed before Jimbo gets here.	What do you like about him? Hes just a good-lookin rebel who plays by his own rules.
Come on, Marge, let the people see your pretty face.	Whats wrong?
Well... Okay.	Ive gotta do something. Hmmmm.
Please, dude, dont hurt me. Oh man... .	Thats your outlaw?
Well, Bart, you were right about him.	As usual. A knife-wielding maniac has shown us the way.
You know, if you were only old enough to grow a bad teenage mustache, Id go out with you in a second.	Wow...
Of course Im Batman! See? Heres a picture of me with Robin.	Who the hell is Robin?
Almost time for our commercial.	Dad, whos watching TV at 317 a.m.?
Stop!	Mr. Plow!
Absolutely! My prices are so low, youll think Ive suffered brain damage.	You are fully bonded and licensed by the city, arent you Mr. Plow?
Ooh / Meow / Dad, stop youre embarrassing us / Stop please.	Stop it right now.
Maggie, can you say ba-ba? Can you say Ma-ma?	Can you say get bent?
Bart!	Mr. Rogers says it all the time.
Be-bop? Be-bop?	Shove it? Shove it?
According to Fretful Mother magazine, if Maggie doesnt talk by age one, we should consider a corrective tongue extender.	Hey, what was my first word?
WHEN THE WORKING DAY IS DONE / GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FU-UN / THATS ALL WE REALLY WANNNNT...	Homer!
Homer is what grown ups call me. Call me Daddy.	Homer.
Daddy.	Homer.
Daddy.	Da... da... da...
Ye-esss...	Domer.
Then the prince and the princess got married and lived happily ever after.	Then what happened?
Uh, They had 30 sons and 30 daughters.	What were their names?
Hi yo!	Hi yo!
Heh, heh. Got your nose.	Got your wallet.
Nooo! Bart, dont you ever do that again. Understand?	Beep.
Marge thats...	Bye-bye, keys.
Who did this?	Baby.
Bad baby!	Heh, heh, heh.
Heh, heh, heh.	Uh-oh.
Hey, Bart, want a dollar? Uh, uh, uh, you know what I want to hear.	IM A LITTLE TEAPOT, SHORT AND STOUT / THIS IS MY HANDLE/ THIS IS MY SPOUT... THE ITSY-BITSY SPIDER WENT UP THE WATER SPOUT, ETC...
Oh yeah.	DOWN CAME THE RAIN, AND WASHED THE SPIDER OUT.
I wish we lived in the kitty house.	I could have trained them to be my unholy army of the night. Go my pretties... kill, kill!
Wait a minute. That was a Lucy show... Okay, where were we?	Mom was pregnant and Dad just threw our money down the sink hole.
Ah yes. I remember the day we moved in...	Hey, Homer. This house sucks.
Bart, I told you not to use that word. Call me Daddy.	Homer. Nyahhh.
Hi, Flanders.	Who the Hell are you?
Anyway, Bart had just entered the terrible twos.	I AM SO GREAT / I AM SO GREAT / EVERYBODY LOVES ME / I AM SO GREAT... / EVERYBODY LOVES ME...
Oh, honey... honey... honey... HONEY. Could you please be quiet?	QUIET, BIET, DIET, ZIET, FIET...
Bart, from now on, the baby sleeps in the crib.	Crib! Crib! Im a baby!
If you should die before you wake...	Cant sleep... Clownll eat me... Cant sleep... Clownll eat me...
Iron helps us play!	I want to go home.
I want to go home.	No I dont.
Well, Bart, what do you think of little Lisa?	I hate you.
Mondale to Hart Wheres the Beef?	Wheres the beef? What the hells that supposed to mean?
Aw. Im gonna give her a kiss.	I know a new song.
You still here?	Allouetty, jaunty allouetty, allouetty... ...Hmm. Allouetty...
She has the reflexes of a young Mary Lou Retton. Have a wowwy-pop.	Can I have a lolly-pop?
Goodnight, honey.	Hello, Lisa.
Lisa, time for your feed --	Whos cuter now?
Whos cuter now?	She started it... came at me with a pipe...
She started it... came at me with a pipe...	Stupid mailman... squeal on me...
Boy, you get over to the corner and you ... yeah.	I liked it when it was me, Mom and Homer. You wrecked everything. Im leaving. Goodbye.
Bart.	What did you say?
Bart!	Sufferin succotash! You can talk!
Sufferin succotash! You can talk!	Mom, Dad, she can talk! Say it again, Lis.
Bart. Bart Bart Bart Bart Bart.	Im her first word!
Well, Im not surprised. Lisas crazy about you. She thinks you hung the moon.	Wow! Lisa, can you say Mommy?
I dont see your name on it.	Its right there.
Ha, ha. Mom yelled at you.	Did not.
Just workin the turkey through. There it goes!	Hey Lis, there was a big train wreck last night. You wanna see the victims?
Bart, thats gross!	Youre right. Lets bury them at sea.
Trust me.	Dad, theres a bug on that.
No, but the rabbi gave me this.	What is it, Dad?
Oh, Homie, I dont know. This might upset them.	Nothing you say can upset us. Were the MTV generation.
Uh, yeah.	Oh, no. What if they botch it? I wont have a dad... for a while.
Kids. Kids... Im not gonna die. That only happens to bad people.	What about Abraham Lincoln?
I know youre gonna turn out great, with or without your old man.	Thanks dad.
All right, Dad!	You rule intensive care!
Hm excellent. Hello, Lisa. Im Genghis Khan. Youll go where I go. Defile what I defile. Eat who I eat. Hmm?	Cmon, Lis. We both know how this money should, nay, must be spent.
But Main Streets still all cracked and broken.	Sorry, Mom, the mob has spoken.
Really?	Wow, Dad. You really know your monorails.
Hmmm, false... No, wait. Maybe its true.	No, you were right, its false. Wow, you really are gonna be a monorail conductor!
Heh-heh. Kids.	But now, I want to follow in your footsteps.
Do you want to change your name to Homer Junior? The kids can call you Hoju!	Ill get back to you.
Stick your head out the window, boy. Its the greatest!	Yee-hawww!
Are we gonna die, son?	Yeah, but at least well take a lot of innocent people with us.
Donuts. Is there anything they cant do?	Dad, youre a hero!
Kids, I have some bad news. Your Great Aunt Gladys has... passed on.	Gladys, Gladys... `bout yay high, blue hair, big dent in her forehead?
No honey, Gladys looked more like your Aunt Patty.	Oh yeah, there she is.
We understand.	No use complaining about something you cant change.
Ding-dong, the witch is dead.	WHICH OLD WITCH?
Just close your eyes and think of MacGyver.	Hey Homer, this luggage is crushing me.
What are you kids playing?	Counting game.
Dont hassle the dead, boy. They have eerie powers.	Eh.
HEY KIDS / TAKE A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE / AND ALL THE RACES SING / DOO DOO DOO / SHOO-BEE DOOBEE DOO...DO DO DO... SHOO-BEE DOOBEE DOO... YEAH!	Can we go to Duff Gardens this weekend?
Well have fun, wont we kids?	To get to Duff Gardens, Id ride with Satan himself.
But I love solids.	It wont be any fun without you, Dad.
There it is!	The Duff Beeramid.
Look! Its the Seven Duffs!	Theres Tipsy! And theres Queasy!
Settle down. Anything this bad has to be educational. Bart!	Lets see if they wore underwear back then.
Lets see if they wore underwear back then.	Yeah!
Beer Goggles - See the World Through the Eyes of a Drunk.	Wow!
Youre charming the pants off of me.	Whatd you say, Aunt Selma?
DUFF BEER FOR ME/ DUFF BEER FOR YOU/ ILL HAVE A DUFF/ YOU HAVE ONE TOO/ DUFF BEER FOR ME/ DUFF BEER FOR YOU/ ILL HAVE A DUFF/ YOU HAVE ONE TOO/	I want to get off.
You cant get off. We have five more continents to visit.	Hey Lis. I dare you to drink the water.
Im not sure that is water.	Chicken?
Ahhh, I can see the music.	Mitch, youre doing a bang-up job.
Eye of the Tiger, Bart. Eye of the--	I stopped it!
Its called Barton Fink!	No thanks, I told my Dad Id wait for him.
I AM WOMAN HEAR ME ROAR / IN NUMBERS TOO BIG TO IGNORE / AND I KNOW TOO MUCH TO GO BACK TO TODAY	Dad, where are you?
This isnt funny.	Homer Simpson! Homer Simpson! Pick up Bart! Pick up Bart!
When Lorne asked me to host this show, I said Lorne, why me? I mean, I did just star in my first movie with Marvin Hagler and Tovah Borgnine. Yeah! Anyway. We got a great show for you. Well actually, the last half hour is a real garbage dump. Uh... well be right back.	I miss Joe Piscopo.
No, hes not. But at Bigger Brothers we can help.	Hello, Bigger Brothers? My name is Bart Simpson and I dont have a father.
Bart Simpson?	Yo!
Yo!	Im Tom. Lets ride.
Im Tom. Lets ride.	Barts dad has really pulled himself together.
Your dad ever take you to baseball games?	Nah, his game was blackjack. He bet our life savings on a single hand.
Hes not dead, is he Bart?	Nah... But I wouldnt give him any homework for a while.
Very good, Bart. Thank you.	Oh, dont thank me. Thank an unprece-dented eight-year military build-up.
Hey, boy! Where you going?	Father-son picnic.
Hey, look at that forest fire down there.	Yeah. Great.
Whats the matter?	Well... Ive been thinking. Youve been really great to me... but theres probably some other kid who needs you even more.
Hello, son. Where have you been?	Playing with Milhouse.
No, you havent! Youve been out gallivanting around with that floozy of a bigger brother of yours! Havent you, havent you. Look at me.	Dad, it just kinda happened. Youre taking this too hard.
How would you like me to take it? Go ahead, Bart, have your fun, Ill be waiting for you? Im sorry, I cant do it.	Well, what are you going to do?
Well, what are you going to do?	Ho, ho, youll see.
Son, I just want you to know I love you very much.	Shaddap!
Whats the matter?	Uh-oh. Better not let him see me.
I gave it to Pepi.	Who the hell is Pepi?
Hes my little brother. Thats right -- youre not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization.	Who needs you? Toms a better father than you ever were.
Come on, Bart. We had our fun. Remember when I used to push you on the swing?	I was faking it.
Liar!	Oh yeah? Remember this? Higher, Dad, higher!... Whee, whee... Push harder, Dad!...
This is even more painful than it looks.	This is all my fault, Dad. I didnt want you to get hurt.
Well, goodbye.	Wait! Ive got an idea!
I ate it.	Dad, remember when Tom had you in that headlock and you screamed, Im a hemophiliac and when he let you go you kicked him in the back?
Yeah?	Will you teach me how to do that?
And then when hes lying on the ground...	Yeah.
Kick him in the ribs...	Yeah.
Oh, no. Its a package from Ralph.	Ill bet you have a lot of things planned, eh Dad?
JOHNNY!!	Cool, I broke his brain.
Bart, whats wrong?	My baboon heart! Body... rejecting it...
Everyones always kissing your ass. Well Im not afraid to tell you youre a .	Oh, Id give anything to go to that show!
Id sell my first-born son.	Hey!
Now, why do they call this a Urine Monkey? Ugh... I just found out.	Thats funny for so many reasons. We have to go to that show.
Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show! Oh, he must want me to go with him.	Oh, it isnt fair. Im ten times the Krusty fan you are. I even have the Krusty home pregnancy test.
Im not sure I should go. I dont even like him.	Youre right, Lis. You shouldnt go. It wouldnt be honest. Ill go, disguised as you.
What if he wants to hold hands?	Im prepared to make that sacrifice.
What if he wants a kiss?	Im prepared to make that sacrifice.
What if he...	You dont want to know how far Ill go.
First prize... first prize...	Watch this, Lis. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half.
Watch this, Lis. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half.	A-a-a-a-and, now.
ADEQUATE / FORGETTABLE / OCCASIONALLY REGRETTABLE / CARETAKER PRESIDENTS OF THE U... S... A...!	Hey, girls. Check out this President.
Hey, girls. Check out this President.	I am not a butt.
Bart, do you want to play John Wilkes Booth, or do you want to act like a maniac?	Ill be good.
Oh, no! John Wilkes Booth!	Hasta la vista, Abie.
Youre next, Chester A. Arthur!	Unhand me, Yankee.
Go-go ray?	Allow me to demonstrate.
First prize... first prize...	Why are you saying that?
Ive grown a futuristic tomato by fertilizing it with Anabolic steroids.	The kind that help our Olympic athletes reach new peaks of excellence?
Wheres your Science Fair project, boy?	I thought Id investigate the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs.
Oh Bart, I forgot my math book. Would you hold this for me, please?	Soitenly. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck.
Well, I got an idea! Why dont you run a hamster through a maze?	Help me! Help me!
I propose to determine the answer to the question Is my brother dumber than a hamster?	Hey Lis, look what I can do.
Hey Lis, look what I can do.	Doggone it.
Remarkable.	Stupid books. Hey, a cupcake.
Stupid books. Hey, a cupcake.	Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.	Aaahhh!
The hamster has learned a valuable lesson. Beware the hand of man.	Oooh - wise guy, eh?
Oooh - wise guy, eh?	Ow... ow... ow!
Bart, could you go get the cupcakes?	Cupcakes, cupcakes. Yes, sweet cakes for all.
Huh?	Shell pay for this. Im gonna crush her like this pellet.
Shell pay for this. Im gonna crush her like this pellet.	Ow! Ow! Ow!
What have you done with my report?	Ive hidden it. To find it, youll need to decipher a series of clues, each more fiendish than the...
Please, Mother. Its purely in the interest of science.	Step right up folks! Well answer the question that has been plaguing scientists for ages. Can hamsters fly planes?
Thats enough. Thats enough.	Doctor Wolfe likes to pull kids teeth so he can sell them.
To who?	You know that rattle when you shake up spray paint? Thats a kids tooth.
Bart!	We can stick her in a trailer, drive her around the South, and charge two bits a gander.
Well, that depends on whos a better negotiator, Mr. Burns or me.	Dad, Ill trade you this delicious door stop for your crummy ol danish.
Haw, haw. April Fools! Ive been keepin that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! Sucker!	Youre goin down, Homer! Im gonna fool you!
You talk better than you fool.	Ill fool you up real nice!
Ah, beer. My one weakness. My Achilles heel, if you will.	Beer! Beer is the cheese. But how to use it...
Hey kid. Thats for customers only.	Uh, did you know theres a guy outside handing out free Stridex pads?
Wow, Im in pizza-face paradise.	Moron.
Mmmm... beer.	April F...
Arrrgh!	Just testing.
Bart, how could you shock your little sister?	My finger slipped.
My finger slipped.	Arrrgh!
Arrrgh!	Arrrgh!
Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God.	I love you, Dad.
Thats right. And for an extra twenty dollars Ill give Homer a tick bath and then spay him.	Here ya go, Doc.
Bart!	Shop around. You cant beat that price.
Okay, okay. This time Ill just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him.	Right, Dad.
The burgers are getting cold, guys. Holy moly.	And theres one Itchy and Scratchy cartoon I dont think well ever forget.
Whyd you bring that up?	It was an amusing episode... of our lives.
Oh, heck, no! You relive long lost-summers, kiss girls from high school -- its like one of those TV shows where they show a buncha clips from old episodes.	Yeah, well, anyway, I wonder what hes thinking now.
Oof.	And sometimes I got into trouble...
Bart, you cant go on like this.	I know.
I know.	...but you always looked out for me.
Theyre fine.	And no matter what happens, Ill never forget the advice you gave me.
Ah! Ooh! Arg! Son of a -- ! Ah! And thats how we shave.	Dad, its all my fault! I shook up that can of beer!
Dad, its all my fault! I shook up that can of beer!	It was just an April Fools joke.
Gotcha! Its April Fools for two more minutes!	Dad, its May 16th.
Marge, it happened again!	What are you gonna change your name to when you grow up?
Lois Sanborn.	Steve Bennett.
This is a rather lifeless outing.	Dont worry. Theyre building to something.
Thats as bad as the tasteless Itchy and Sambo cartoons of the late 30s. The writers should be ashamed of themselves.	Cartoons have writers?
Yeah, sort of.	Oh, yeah, well you and I could write a better cartoon than that.
Write a cartoon ourselves? Bart, are you thinking what Im thinking?	Probably not.
Probably not.	Lie in the snow and count to sixty.
Lie in the snow and count to sixty.	Giddiyup! Merry Christmas, suckers.
According to this book, the first thing we need is a setting.	Okay... setting... setting... setting... setting...
Okay... setting... setting... setting... setting...	How about a barber shop?
Scratchy is getting a haircut. Then Itchy -- the barber -- chops Scratchys head off with a razor!	Eh, too predictable. The way I see it, instead of shampoo Itchy covers Scratchys hair with barbecue sauce... opens a box of flesh-eating ants... and the rest writes itself.
Finished. Now all we have to do is put our names on it.	Fine. Put my name first.
No way.	All right, then to decide it, I propose a race around the world. Meet me at Luster Square at noon tomorrow. The queen herself shall drop the checkered flag.
Look theres only one reasonable way to settle this rock, paper, scissors.	Rock.
Bart, they rejected our script.	I guess were just not cut out to be writers.
Maybe he just doesnt take us seriously cause were kids. Lets put a grownups name on it.	Well, how about Grampa? Hes pretty out of it. He let those guys use his check book for a whole year.
... when I read your magazine I dont see one wrinkled face or a single toothless grin. For shame! To the sickos at Modern Bride magazine.	Hey Grampa, we need to know your first name.
Okay now, lets move on...	Grampa? Grampa?
Bart! Our Cartoons on TV!	All right! Turn up the volume.
Bart, Lisa I have something to tell you, and Im not proud of it.	Dad, whatever you say, you know you will always have my love and respect.
Lalalalalalalalalalalala.	Dad, can we talk to Grampa alone for a minute?
... then we put your name on the script and sent it in.	Didnt you wonder why you were getting checks for doing absolutely nothing?
Whyd you wake me? I was having the nicest dream. I dreamt I was the Queen of the Old West. I kept a six shooter in my garter, I did...	Do we have a deal?
Thank you for this award. It is a tribute to this great country, that a man who once took a shot at Teddy Roosevelt could win back your trust.	Yo, Grampa! Time for the awards.
And the winner is... Itchy and Scratchy, Abraham Simpson writer!	Ah, Grampa! Woo!
Nope.	Ill never watch an awards show again... unless that delightful Billy Crystals involved.
Fools! Whoops. Still on.	Hey, what do you think he meant by that fools remark?
I cant take it!	Hey, I think I can squeeze through that vent.
Now, remember little dude, youre our only hope.	Ow!
Come on Bart. Ride me.	I better not.
Hes insulting both of us.	Lets go.
I learned how many drams in a pennyweight.	I got expelled.
Mmmm, beer... What?	Look, Dad. I dont need school. Ill make my way as a bootblack. Shine yer boots Guvnor?
Now remember Bart. This is a religious school. So be very careful about what you say and do here.	No problemo.
Now Bart, since youre new here, perhaps youd favor us with a psalm.	How about Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit?
Yoo hoo.	BEANS, BEANS, THE MUSICAL FRUIT / THE MORE YOU EAT THE MORE YOU TOOT...
Wed like you to try this new diet cola. We call it Natures Goodness.	Whats in it?
Two four des-oxy-propheniramine.	Sweet.
Pleasing taste. Some monsterism.	Cool.
I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER... I AM EVIL HO-MER...	Have a nice day at school, Lis. Ill just try to make the best of a bad situation. Ahhh...
Im your new teacher. My name is Mrs. Simpson.	I didnt do it.
Ach du lieber! That is not ein a booby!	Is that story true, Grampa?
Bart, Id like you to read this copy of Johnny Tremain. Its a book I read as a girl.	A book?
I think you might like this... Its about a boy who goes to war... his hand is deformed in an accident...	Deformed? Why didnt you say so? They should call this book Johnny Deformed!
Any experience?	Thanks, Seymour.
The enemy surrounded the fort and said that if the captain was sent out the rest would be spared.	What did they do?
They sent him out.	Was he killed?
This is Jebediah Springfield at the Battle of Ticonderoga. Next. And here he is killing a snake on the very first Whacking Day in 1775.	Hey wait a minute. That was the same day he was at Ticonderoga. How could he be in two places at once?
If the snakes were in here we could protect them.	Well, according to this, snakes hear by sensing vibrations in the ground. So, if we put our stereo speakers on the ground and play something with a lot of bass, those snakesll be in here like Oprah on a baked ham.
Hey! Whered all the snakes go?	People of Springfield! Whacking Day is a sham!
People of Springfield! Whacking Day is a sham!	It was started in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish.
Snake did.	And you like snakes, dont you Barry White?
Oh my Juice Looseners never gonna come.	Hey, dad. This came for you in the mail.
Now, hurry up or youll miss your bus.	Maybe you better take that temperature one more time.
Mom, can you bring me more O.J.?	Can you get me some of those Flintstones chewable morphine?
Mom, I need more O.J.	... Flintstones chewable morphine.
Mom, I need more O.J.	... Flintstones chewable morphine.
O.J.	Morphine
O.J.	Morphine
Uh, was he the black guy on the Mod Squad?	Mr. Hutz when I grow up I want to be a lawyer just like you.
Now you kids be good while mothers in prison.	Dont worry, Mom. Ill bust ya outta there just as soon as I get a cocktail dress and a crowbar.
Bartina, until I met you, I was the loneliest warden in the penal system.	Fresh!
Now kids, while your mothers gone, I dont wanna have to wash any dishes. So, from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton, and well eat while standing over the sink or toilet.	Whos gonna change Maggie?
Excuse me, but I think if we all do our fair share, we can keep this house clean.	Dad! Were running out of clean clothes!
Alright! Bologna and cheese. What do you got, Bart?	A pack of sugar and peanut butter smeared on a playing card.
Haw, haw! Your moms a jailbird!	Sos yours.
So how are things at home?	We flushed the gator down the toilet, but it got stuck halfway and now we have to feed it.
Weve gotta clean this up before mom gets back.	No problemo. Well just sweep it all under the rug.
Gabbo! Gabbo! Gabbo!	Did you see that?
Yeah.	Whats Gabbo?
Thats the same time as Krusty the Klown!	Uh-oh. That cute little character could take America by storm. All he needs is a hook.
Im a bad widdle boy.	Ay carumba!
And now, its time for another patented Gabbo Crank Call! Oh I love these.	I cant believe it. He stole this bit from Krusty!
What the? If this is anyone but Steve Allen, youre stealing my bit.	Somebody ought to ruin Gabbos career the way he ruined Krustys.
Two wrongs dont make a right, Bart.	Yes they do.
No they dont.	Yes they do.
No they dont.	Yes they do.
I wish youd stop saying that.	Hmmm.
Hey, boyo, whats so funny?	Well, its... Ah, you wouldnt be interested. Its too low brow.
No Im quite low brow.	Well... somebody just wrote a bawdy limerick on the mens room wall.
Oh no!	Krusty, are you making any money?
Thirty-five years in show business and already no one remembers me. Just like whats his name... and whosis... and you know, that guy, always wore a shirt...	Ed Sullivan?
Yeah.	I didnt know you knew Luke Perry!
Yeah, on Fox...	Elizabeth Taylor... Bette Midler...
A lot of people know about the grotto and the game room...	Of course.
But few know about the laboratory, the biosphere, the alternative energy research center...	Fascinating.
Yes. The grotto uses so much water... the bunnies felt we should go this way.	Smart bunnies, Hef. I can call you Hef, cant I?
We want Chilly Willy! We want Chilly Willy!	Hey, Red Hot Chili Peppers. Would you guys like to appear on a Krusty the Klown Special?
Sure -- if you get us out of this gig.	No problemo. Hey, Moe! Look over there.
Ill never get my aim back.	Youve got to keep working on it.
Im a star again. I dont know how to thank you kids.	Thats alright, Krusty.
What!? Thats the sweetest plum. You... little... Ahh. What the Hell. You deserve it. Thanks kids.	To Krusty. The greatest entertainer in the world. Except maybe that guy.
Oyster shells, hand painted to resemble Lucille Ball! Youll love Oyster Lucy! Oh Mr. Mooney, I just gotta meet Bob Cummings. Vivvv!!!	Oh boy! Free trading cards!
Well, boys, whod have thought learning about religion could be fun?	Religion?
Bart, look! Its Dad!	Dad, when did you record an album?
Im surprised you dont remember, son. It was only eight years ago.	Dad, thanks to television, I cant remember what happened eight minutes ago.
Dad, thanks to television, I cant remember what happened eight minutes ago.	No, really, I cant. Its a serious problem.
No, really, I cant. Its a serious problem.	What are we all laughing about?
Bart, what did I tell you?	No talking like a grizzled 1890s prospector... consarnit!
Whatd you kids get?	I bought this cool pencil holder.
... IM TELLING YOU, ITS MIGHTY NICE / EACH TRIPS A TRIP TO PARADISE...	Yeah!
They took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. But if you ask me, if youre dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. Bart!	What?
I cant believe youre not still popular.	Whatd you do... screw up like The Beatles and say you were bigger than Jesus?
What about Bob Hope? Hes been consistently popular for over 50 years.	So has Sinatra.
Dean Martin still packs em in.	Ditto Tom Jones.
Ill never forget my five-and-a-half weeks at the top.	Man, thats some story.
But there are still a few things I dont get. Like how come we never heard about this until today?	Yeah, and what happened to the money you made?
Why havent you hung up your gold record?	Since when could you write a song?
You got a letter too, Bart.	Im going to kill you.
Haw haw!	But whod want to hurt me? Im this centurys Dennis the Menace.
I say we call Matlock. Hell find the culprit. Its probably that evil Gavin McCloud or George Goober Lindsey.	Grampa, Matlocks not real.
I checked around. The girls are calling you fatty fat fat fat, and Nelsons planning to pull down your pants, but nobodys trying to kill you.	Thats good.
Bart, I figured it out. Whos someone youve been making irritating phone calls to for years?	Linda Lavin?
Sideshow Bob!	You wrote me those letters.
This isnt just because of Sideshow Bob. Its a chance to turn around all our stinking lives.	Ill be Gus, the lovable chimney sweep. Clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all Westminster. Yeah!
EVERYTHING IS A SOURCE OF FUN...	HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.
Aaah...	Mom! Dad! I saw Sideshow Bob and he threatened to kill me!
Cmon, let me cut you a brownie while theyre still hot.	Dad, Im kinda edgy right now. Id appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife.
Hello, Bart.	Mom! Dad!
Well, Bart. Any last requests?	Well, there is one, but...
Well, there is one, but...	Nah.
No, go on.	Well, you have such a beautiful voice...
Guilty as charged.	Uh-huh. Anyway... I was wondering if you could sing the entire score of The HMS Pinafore?
WHAT NEVER? / NO NEVER / WHAT NEVER?...	HARDLY EVER! HES HARDLY EVER SICK AT SEA!
Ooh, a plan fiendishly clever in its intricacies.	Take him away, boys.
So you want me to go to college?	College? Barber or clown?
... it was the most I ever threw-up and it changed my life forever.	You the man, Homer.
Thanks boy. Now, for the crowning touch...	I dunno, Dad. Dont you have a better picture?
Woo hoo! A flyer for a hardware store!	Well, Pop, what are you gonna do?
We played Dungeons and Dragons for three hours. Then I was slain by an elf.	Listen to yourself, man. Youre hangin with nerds.
I got it! We wait by his mailbox, and when he comes outside, we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.	So its a prank youre lookin for, is it? Ill give you your prank...
So its a prank youre lookin for, is it? Ill give you your prank...	The only other college in fifty miles is Springfield A&M, so theyre our best target.
Those bastards...	Meet Sir Oinks-A-lot, the beloved mascot of Springfield A&M. Here he is presiding over last years homecoming. Here he is conferring an honorary degree on Richard Nixon. And here he is rolling in his own filth. Gentlemen, I propose we kidnap Sir Oinks-A-lot...
I heard about this. This is the one where Scratchy finally gets Itchy.	Wow!
Wow!	My purpose in life is to witness this moment.
Now Im not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...	Incontinent... Too rich.
Bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father.	Yesm. Dad, I know youre discouraged, but please dont deny the world your fat can.
Hey, its a Teddy bear!	Ew! Gross! Its probably diseased or something. Here, Maggie.
Hmm, better sew that eye back on.	No. Lets send Burns the eye in the mail. Hell pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger.
Paintings. Lifeless images rendered in colorful goop. But at night, they take on a life of their own.	They become portals to hell so scary and horrible and gruesome that --
Bart! You should warn people this episode is very frightening and maybe theyd rather listen to that old War of the Worlds broadcast on NPR, Hmmm?	Yes, mother.
Good, now you hold Maggie. Im going to buy some earrings at the gift shop.	The subject of our first painting tonight is the most foul, evil, vicious, diabolical beast to stalk the earth. Of course, I refer to...
The subject of our first painting tonight is the most foul, evil, vicious, diabolical beast to stalk the earth. Of course, I refer to...	Buh Dmfl! The Devil!
Hey, Bart.	Hey.
Nope. It says right there, school bus.	Well, theres nothing scarier than having to go to school. Ugh.
Hey, Bart, look! Krusty Trading Cards! The long awaited Eighth Series!	Krusty Visits Relatives in Annapolis, Maryland...
Krusty Visits Relatives in Annapolis, Maryland...	Krusty Poses for Trading Card Photo.
Hmm. He seems to be running a little low on ideas.	Well, at least you got the gum.
Bart, whats wrong?	I just had a vision of my own horrible, fiery death.
Thank goodness hes drawn attention away from my shirt.	Milhouse. Milhouse, wake up. Quick, look out the window.
No way, Bart. If I lean over, I leave myself open to wedgies, Wet Willies, or even the dreaded Rear Admiral.	Otto, you gotta do something! Theres a gremlin on the side of the bus!
No. Oh, no. I just made my last payment.	Eyahh! Everybody! Theres a monster on the side of the bus!
Now Ive gotten word that a child is using his imagination, and Ive come to put a stop to it.	No! No, its true! Theres a monster on the bus.
Ach! My mule wouldnt walk in the mud! So I had to put 17 bullets in him.	You believe me, dont you? Youre my friend who believes me! Sweet, trustworthy Milhouse.
Oh Guten tag! Vould you care for a bite of my VenglerStrasse bar? I also have a bag of marzipan Joy-Joys!	The gremlins taking off the wheel! Stop the bus or were all gonna die!
Would you like another lick of my Flavor-Wax?	Uh, sure. Well, now that were friends, Uter, how bout loosening these straps, huh?
Gad Zooks!	Look at the bus! I was right, I tell ya! I was right!
Theyre dogs! And theyre playing poker!	We had a story to go with this painting, but it was far too intense. So we just threw something together with vampires. Enjoy!
Whoops. Bart and I have to go wash up.	But, you didnt get any on m...
But, you didnt get any on m...	Uhhh.
Uhhh.	Lisa, Burns isnt a vampire. And even if he was, were not gonna stumble on his secret hiding place.
Satisfied?	Big deal. Its no different from the basement in Grampas rest home.
Oh my God!	Be be be be be.
Please, Bart, Ive seen your stupid Shemp.	Nyung, nyung, nyung nyung.
I know I really shouldnt, but when am I going to be here again?	Whee!
Why Bart is right here.	Hello, Mother. Hello, Father. I missed you during my uneventful absence.
No! No!	Lisa, its not like you have a choice here.
Grampas a vampire?!	Were all vampires.
At the Apple Biscuit Cafe, where the smiles are free, dont ya know, Sven Ingqvist studied the menu. And finally, he ordered the same thing he has every day.	Maybe its the TV.
Have a blast, Mom!	Rock the Casbah!
I cant believe your mother went out to have fun without me.	Dont worry. Youll feel better once we put your hair up in curlers and give you a makeover, Homina...
Oh Lisa, havent you seen Home Alone? If some burglars come, itll be a very humorous and entertaining situation.	Youre absolutely right, Homer. We dont need a baby-sitter.
You kids do need a baby-sitter.	Blast that infernal card! Dont give that card to me.
I always knew some day Mom would violently rise up, and cast off the shackles of our male oppressors.	Eh, shut your yap.
Tram...Ample...Een! Tram...Baple...Een!	He said what now?
Hi, son. Hi, son. Hi, son.	WOWWW!!
Dad, this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering.	Look at me! /
Look at me! /	I will never get tired of this.
Rust I tell ya.	Dad. Dad! You really want to get rid of this trampoline?
Uh-huh.	Observe - a bike lock.
Observe - a bike lock.	Now just turn around and count to three.
Now just turn around and count to three.	One, two, three.
One, two, three.	Uh, better make it five.
Homer, did you eat my whole pan of brownies?	Uh-oh. Youre in for it now, Dad.
I just thought Id remind everybody. After all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar.	What an odd thing to say.
You see, folks? Were all trying to please someone else. And as soon as youre not a human BE-ING, youre a human DO-ING! Then what comes next?	A human GOING!
What made you yell out that remark?	I unno.
You just wanted to express yourself. Yes?	I do what I feel like.
Son, youve never read any of my books, have you?	Earth to boring guy.
We can all learn a lot from this young man, here, this... this...	Rudiger.
Is that why youre sitting on an ice cream sandwich?	Ewww... uhh.
I want-a to change-a my name-a!	It was...
Our 10th caller will receive tickets to Supertramp.	Aw geez. Everybodys a comedian.
Im blue. Time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass.	Oh, man.
Its simple, Bart. Youve defined yourself as a rebel. And in the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted.	I see.
Ever since that self-help guy came to town, youve lost your identity. Youve fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-hour-photo, instant-oatmeal society.	Whats the answer?
Well, this is your chance to develop a new and better identity. May I suggest good-natured doormat?	Sounds good, sis. Just tell me what to do.
Cowabunga!	Skateboards? You copycat wannabes.
Skateboards? You copycat wannabes.	Ow!
Get him!	Eep.
Oooh, its that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time.	Crank it, Homer.
Tell me more!	Keep cool, Simpson. Be in the game, but not of the game.
Winners dont use drugs.	Oh. Im out of money.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.	You know, this is wearing a bit thin.
Bart, look!	Maybe a plane exploded.
Apu, give us a Super-Squishee.	One thats made entirely out of syrup.
Entirely out of... An all-syrup Super-Squishee? S-such a thing has never been done.	Just make it happen.
Your turn, Bart.	Wowww... Thats good Squishee.
Uh.	OK... Were young, rich and full of sugar. What do we do?
SPRINGFIELD, SPRINGFIELD!/ ITS A HELL OF A TOWN!/ THE SCHOOLYARDS UP AND THE SHOPPING MALLS DOWN!/ THE STRAY DOGS GO TO THE ANIMAL POUND!	SPRINGFIELD, SPRINGFIELD--!
NEW YORK, NEW YORK--!	NEW YORK IS THAT-A-WAY, MAN.
Tsk, tsk. The remorse of the sugar junkie.	I dont remember anything.
Really? Not even this?	Oh, no. I must have joined the Junior Campers!
The few, the proud, the geeky.	Boy, a man on a Squishee-bender can sure do some crazy things.
Keep-away! Keep-away!	Yeah. Whatever.
Keep-away! Keep-away! What a baby!	Oh no. Woe is me, my precious uniform.
But Im supposed to... Ive got to... Im supposed to...	Um, Mrs. Krabappel...?
Um, Mrs. Krabappel...?	Id love to stay, but this uniform carries certain responsibilities.
Hey look -- Sergeant Dork! Haw haw!	Enjoy your test.
Now, just breathe into him every three seconds. Make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth.	Nooo!
Well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir.	Im outta here, man.
Okay, now, everybody take out your Junior Campers pocketknives...	You guys get to play with knives?
You guys get to play with knives?	Cool! A spork!
Oop, sorry, Bart, thats a Neddy no-no. Youre not allowed to handle a pocketknife til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test.	Aw, who needs a cruddy knife anyway?
Dont thank me thank the knife.	Seems like everywhere I look people are enjoying knives.
Dont Do What Donny Dont Does. They couldve made this clearer.	They wont let you have any fun.
Here you go, your rubber training knife. Youve attained the rank of Pussy Willow.	Rubber knife? This place is for wimps.
Okay, kids, now Im gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. But this should only be used in a life or death situation.	Hmmm...
Howdilly hey, Camper Bart. Ready for todays meeting?	You know-it-know it, Neddy.
Okilly dokilly. Now, our annual Father-Son Rafting Trip is next weekend.	Oh, no. Me bring Homer on a rafting trip?
Stupid poetic justice...!	Actually, we were just planing the father-son river rafting trip.
Oh pardon me, Mr. Lets Ration Everything, but what do you think were floatin on? Dont you know the poem? Water, water everywhere/ So lets all have a drink.	Homer! No!
Woo-hoo! See that, boy? Your old man was right, not Flanders. We are doomed! In your face, Flanders!	Well, at least Ned is trying! What are you doing to help?
Thank you, Homer, I dunno what got--	Dad, I think hes oka--
Son, theres something I was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, I want you to have it now.	A real Swiss army knife. Cool!
Thanks boy. Now be careful when you...	Dad, dont take this wrong, but your expression doesnt fill me with confidence.
The foul stench of death is upon us. Mmmm... hamburgers.	Hey, wait! I smell hamburgers too.
You want fries with that?	You did it, Dad! You saved us! Im proud youre my father.
Class, I know theres no way to prove who actually did this, and in our American Democracy, everyone is innocent until proven guilty.	God bless America.
Its photosynthesis! Damn your feeble brain!	Oh, I couldnt read it. The letters are all blurry.
Is it possible all your misbehavior and miserable grades have been caused by a simple vision disorder?	You mean it aint me noggin, its me peepers? Well thats just loverly.
Your appearance is comical to me.	Im a nerd.
Uhhh.	Hi, Dad.
Shhh!	What is this place?
Good news, honey. Two weeks are up. You dont have to wear your glasses anymore. And your scalp and posture seem fine.	Yes!
What gives?	Gentlemen, the nerd you knew is dead. Beat me and you will be beating one of your own.
Lisa, just because youre ten feet tall doesnt mean you can tell me what to do.	Im Bart.
Wait a minute, are you over twenty-one?	Are you?
Im not authorized to answer that.	By the way, your martinis suck!
Do you get the feeling this family is disintegrating? I mean we havent had a meal with Mom all week. And she hasnt even started my costume for the Geography Pageant.	Pipe down, sister. Ive gotta book a new act for tonight. Turns out that Liza Minelli impersonator was really Liza Minelli.
Hi. Are you from the casino?	Im from a casino.
Woo hoo!	And our portable TV!
Well... Yes, I do. But theyre all heirlooms, too.	The burglar even took my stamp collection.
Shhh, quiet Lisa.	Hey, the burglar left his calling card.
You folks got robbed too? The burglar took my Shroud of Turin beach towels.	Wow. Its a crime wave.
Me again.	Sorry.
Bart, give me that megaphone of yours.	Its not just a megaphone, Dad. Its a RapMaster 2000.
Asleep at the switch! I wasnt asleep! I was drunk!	I believe you, Dad.
Bart, Ive asked you not to whistle that annoying tune.	Jawohl, mein mommandant.
And thats how I cured all disease, ended war, and reunited the entire cast of TVs Facts Of Life, including long time hold-out, Tootie.	Sounds like another Pulitzer for me to polish.
Impaled on my Nobel Peace Prize. How ironic.	Yo! Lis! Lis! Come back, Lis! Come back!
This may well prove fascinating.	I know, Ill just do like Lisa and escape into fantasy.
Class, instead of going to the box factory, today well be going to the... box factory.	Damn TV, youve ruined my imagination just like youve ruined my ability to... to um, uh... oh well.
Oh, we dont assemble em here. Thats done in Flint, Michigan.	Have any of your workers ever had their hands cut off by the machinery?
No...	...And then the hand started crawling around and tried to strangle everybody?
No, that has never happened.	Any popped eyeballs?
Now heres my office. If you will direct your eyes to the floor, youll see a yellow line. Follow it. It will lead you around my desk ...and back out the door.	I gotta get outta here.
I gotta get outta here.	Aha! The perfect escape!
Do you work here, little boy?	Yeah.
Hmm, mm, mm, tragic news tonight, one hundred and twenty dead in a tidal wave in Kuala Lala...peer... Kuala La Lum... par... France.	Yoink!
Aw heck... now where am I going to get a Danish?	Heres a Danish, Krusty.
Now thats Danish. Whered you get it?	I stole it from Kent Brockman.
Great. He didnt touch it, did he?	No.
Good job, kid. Whats your name?	Im Bart Simpson. I saved you from jail.
I reunited you with your estranged father.	Yes, Krusty?
Yes, Krusty?	I saved your career, man! Remember your comeback special?
Yeah, well what have you done for me lately?	I got you that Danish.
Hey, kid!	Wow! A big clown hankie!
Its a towel, you yutz. I want you to wash it. Youre my new assistant.	Cool!
What is it?	Hi, Homer.
Oh, nothing.	Hey, thats my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated, eight-fold, fourteen-gauge box.
Oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip. Think youd be interested in a career as a box maker?	Well thatll always be the dream, but for now I got a job in the show business. From now on Ill be helping Krusty the clown after school.
Thats not a job. Its a waste of time. What can poor people pay ya? Nothin! What satisfaction do you get from helping em? None! Who wants to help poor people anyway? Nobody!	So, anyway, can I, Mom? Can I take the job?
Yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man.	Dad, Im asking if I can get a job.
Im Kent Brockman, on the eleven oclock news tonight...a certain kind of soft drink has been found to be lethal, we wont tell you which one until after sports and the weather with funny Sonny Storm.	Theres my name. Right there. Bart Simpson.
Its okay, son. Who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? Youre doing what you want to do with your life. Nothing else matters.	Thanks Dad, thats great advice.
Bart, I need to get your fingerprints on a candlestick. Meet me in the conservatory. Chop chop. Dont worry, everythings gonna be all right.	I wish I was dead.
Bah! Theres cheese in this sandwich! Surely you know Im lactose intolerant.	Sorry.
Bart! I need to use you in a sketch.	You want me to be on the show?
Its just one line. Mel was supposed to say it, but hes dead.	Dead?
Or sick. I dunno, I forget. Anyway, all you gotta do is say I am waiting for a bus. Then I hit you with pies for five minutes. Got that?	I am waiting for a bus.
Makes me laugh. Lets go.	I am waiting for a...
I am waiting for a...	I didnt do it.
...Eh? ...Eh?	I didnt do it.
This biography of Bart came out awfully quickly. Its not even about him.	Sure it is. Look at the cover.
Say the line, Bart!	I didnt do it?
Forget it, Dad. If I ever become famous, I want it to be for something worthwhile, not because of some obnoxious fad.	Obnoxious fad?
What the hell are you readin books for?	Im doing the Conan OBrien show and I wanna have some intelligent stuff to talk about.
Dont forget to say I didnt do it.	Dad, theres more to me than just a catchphrase.
How do you figure boy?	Watch the Conan OBrien show. Youll see.
Just do the line.	I didnt do it.
Hi everybody! Lets start the game!	Yargghh!
Bart, its time to get ready for the show.	No!
Honey, I know you feel a little silly saying the same four words over and over, but you shouldnt. Youre making people happy. And thats a very hard thing to do.	Youre right, mom. I shouldnt let this bother me. Im in television now. Its my job to be repetitive... my job, my job. Repetitiveness is my job. I am gonna go out there tonight and give the best performance of my life.
The best performance of your life?	The best performance of my life.
And now... boys and girls... here he is... the boy that says the words youve been longing to hear like the salivating dogs that you are... Bart Simpson!	I didnt do it!
I didnt do it!	I didnt do it.
I didnt do it.	Woozle wozzle.
Ladies and gentlemen, the clown show has been put on hiatus for retooling.	What happened?
Oh, dont worry about that. Youre just finished, thats all.	Finished?
I heard that!	Boy, show business is kinda cruel, isnt it?
I saved these for you, Bart. Youll always have them to remind you of the time when you were the whole worlds special little guy.	Thanks, Mom.
Mmm corn. Havent had that in awhile.	Yeah, delicious corn.
Thats even worse than the album Grampa released.	And he taught me how to do this.
And he taught me how to do this.	I got out of school because I told them I was mangled in a car wreck.
THEY MADE DAD SICKY-MART.	LETS HURL A BRICKY-MART!
Dont ask me -- Im just a girl!	Right on! Say it, sister!
Its not funny, Bart! Millions of girls will grow up thinking that this is the right way to act! That they can never be anything more than vacuous ninnies whose only goal is to look pretty, land a rich husband, and spend all day on the phone with their equally vacuous friends talking about how damn terrific it is to look pretty and have a rich husband!!	Just what I was gonna say.
Lisa -- ordinarily, Id say you should stand up for what you believe in, but you have been doing that an awful lot lately.	Yeah, you made us march in that Gay Rights Parade.
Um, theres something not quite...	How about me?
All right! Now all we need is a name.	How about Blabbermouth -- The Jerky Doll for Jerks?
Hmm, not enough commercial appeal.	Wendy Windbag? Ugly Doris? Hortense The Mule-faced Doll?
I think we should name her after Lisa. Well call her Lisa Lionheart.	No! Loudmouth Lisa!
No! Loudmouth Lisa!	Stupid Lisa Garbageface! I cant stand this any longer! Somebody please pay attention to me!
Stupid Lisa Garbageface! I cant stand this any longer! Somebody please pay attention to me!	Hello! Pay attention to me! Look at me! Im Bart! Im Bart! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!
Stupid carbon rod. Its all just a popularity contest.	Wow! Did you actually get to see the rod?
Make it stop!	Oh no, not another boring space launch! Change the channel! Change the channel!
Pride?	No, not that far from shame.
Less shame?	Yeah.
Its an inanimate carbon rod.	Aww, they were just about to show some close-ups of the rod.
Bart, do you have something nice to say to your father?	Eh, he knows how I feel.
See because of me, now they have a warning.	Hey, Dad... sell you these for fifty bucks.
Dad and Ned Flanders friends? Whats next... As on Barts report card?	Hey.
Love, Marge. Dont hate. Love.	The Flanders are a buncha geeks, man.
The Flanderses are not geeks! Okay, Rod and Todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. But weve got to give this thing a chance. I want the two families to take a trip together this weekend.	No way, JosÃ© !
Dont worry, Bart. It seems like every week something odd happens to the Simpsons. My advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week well be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure.	Ay caramba!
Thank you, but were not allowed.	Aw its okay, theres no sugar in pixie sticks. Trust me.
Food fight!	Yeah!
Just try and stop me.	I dont get it, Lis. You said everything would be back to normal, but Homer and Flanders are still friends.
Hi, Mom.	After breakfast me and Milhouse are goin down to the ravine. We got a tip from a six year old that theres a dead Martian down there.
Id love to honey, but Daddy has to go to a beer drinking contest today.	Think youll win?
Son, when you participate in sporting events, its not whether you win or lose. Its how drunk you get.	Gotcha. Well, gotta go.
Me too.	Uh, its hard for us to leave when youre standing there, Mom.
YOU LOAD SIXTEEN TONS/ WHADDAYA GET/ ANOTHER DAY OLDER AND DEEPER IN DEBT...	Amen, Ernie.
Well, lets make that call.	KBBL is gonna give me something stupid!
Bart, Im having palpitations.	Cant tie up the line, Grampa.
Yello.	KBBL is gonna give me something stupid!
Yello?	I won! I won!
I won! I won!	Wheres my elephant?!
You win your choice of ten thousand dollars or - whats our gag prize this week, Bill? - a full grown African elephant!	Well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, Marty. But I think Im gonna have to go with the elephant.
Kid, the elephants a gag prize. Nobody takes the gag prize. You want the cash.	I want the elephant.
Come on, kid, just take the money, huh? Otherwise we might get fired. You dont want us to get fired, do you?	Eh, either way.
Ill do it, Bart.	Umm... No.
Now wait just a minute. That wasnt discussed with me.	Uh, gentlemen, I am not leaving without my elephant.
Uh, gentlemen, I am not leaving without my elephant.	Hey!
Wee!	Wheres my elephant!
Wheres my elephant!	Wheres my elephant!
Heh, heh, it does look like Al Gore.	He smells worse than anything! Hey, you! Elephant! Lift me up on your back, man.
Bart!!!	Cool! He tried to kill me!
Marge, I agree with you, in theory. In theory Communism works. In theory.	Look, he thinks hes people.
Gnight, Stampy.	Thanks, bud. Preciate it.
Taught Stampy any tricks yet, Bart?	Nah. He doesnt want to learn and I dont want to teach him. We get along fine.
Oh. Good luck. Look at these bills. Chain for elephant, Shots for elephant... Oversized decorative poncho.	Technically, its for a giraffe, but I think I can let it out a little.
Well these billsll have to be paid out of your allowance.	Youll have to raise my allowance to about a thousand dollars a week.
Wait a minute, this gives me an idea.	Uh, heres a better sign, Dad.
This town is full of deadbeats. We cant afford this elephant.	No, Dad, hes my friend!
Little girl, Ive had lots of jobs in my day. Whale hunter, seal clubber, President of the Fox Network. And like most people, yeah Ive dealt a little ivory.	Dad, you cant do this. Stampy is my friend.
Dont worry, Stampy. I wont let Homer sell you to that ivory dealer.	You and I are gonna run away together. Well keep to the back roads, and make our way South. Then, if I know my geography, its just twelve miles to Africa. Okay bud, very quietly, lets just sneak through...
You and I are gonna run away together. Well keep to the back roads, and make our way South. Then, if I know my geography, its just twelve miles to Africa. Okay bud, very quietly, lets just sneak through...	Stampy!
These prehistoric creatures blundered into the tar pits, which preserved their skeletons in showroom condition.	Hes gone forever.
Hes gone forever.	Stampy!
Stampy!	Ahhh. Youre lonely for other elephants, arent you?
Son, youre okay! And youve led us to the precious ivory. And of course your lovable pet, who its connected to...	Dad, I cant let you sell him. Stampy and I are friends.
Dad, I cant let you sell him. Stampy and I are friends.	Ow. Anyway, I want him to go to that animal refuge.
Id like it fine.	Even if he killed you and made your teeth into piano keys?
Homie!	Stampy, quick! Pull him out!
Oh, I guess it wouldnt be right to sell Stampy after he saved my life. And, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him.	Thanks, Dad.
So long Stampy. I know youre gonna like it here.	No, Stampy. No!
No, Stampy. No!	Ah, thanks, boy.
Ah, thanks, boy.	Whoa! Whoa, boy!
Whoa! Whoa, boy!	Atta boy, Stampy. Butt em once for me!
Thats it, boy. Youre our last hope.	I just dont want to be here, Dad. Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on.
Okay, boy, I wrote down exactly what to say. Just read it and youre a shoo-in.	Hello, Mr... Kurns? I bad want... money now. Me sick.
Oooh. He card reads good.	So pick, please, me... Mr. Burns.
Oh, hes the worst yet! Thats it! Everyone out! Except you! One step to the left.	Ow!
I was talking to him. You, what day is this?	Huh?
Oh, yeah. So good...	That explains his mysterious trip to Holland.
No. You know, Bart, since he is giving you all of his money, maybe it would be nice if you spend some time with him.	Well...
Cmon, honey.	All right.
Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of booger man, but Im really not such a bad dude. Oh, your milks gone cold. Ill ring for the maid.	Whoa.
Sorry. Wrong button.	Um, uh, I think Id like to go home.
Aw, if you stay you can have anything you want to eat, even some sort of gelatin dish. Its made from hooves, you know.	Anything, huh? Okay... I want pizza, and I want it delivered by Krusty the Clown.
Hey, its Krusty the pizza man! -- All right, wheres my four hundred bucks?	Hey, wait! How can you be here when your shows on live?
It couldnt possibly be bottomless.	Well, for all intents and purposes.
Bart, dont throw peas at your sister.	Mr. Burns throws peas at Smithers.
That was the end piece. Thats it! Being abusive to your family is one thing but I will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. Go to your room!	No! This family stinks. Mr. Burns nurtures my destructive side. Im suffocating here.
Bart, you listen.	Oh, go eat some flowers.
Bart, youre coming home.	I want to stay here with Mr. Burns.
Cool train. Wheres it go?	Beats me. But it wont be back for three hours and forty minutes. Once it had snow on it.
Wow, Bart! Mr. Burns gives you everything you could ever want. My parents use that old love excuse to screw me out of toys. Well, Im sure youd like to be alone with your possessions.	Uh, Milhouse, if you stay a little while longer, you can have this blazer. Its a Bob Mackie original.
Five, twenty-three skidoo! Hut! Hut!	For me? But I dont know how to drive.
That was delightful! Did you see that? That mouse butchered that cat like a hog! Is all TV this wonderful?	Um, Id kind of like to go home now.
Like a hog! Heh? What? What was that?	Mr. Burns, I dont want to seem ungrateful. But, I want to go home to my family.
Boh!	Its probably my imagination but something about them didnt seem quite right.
Doh!	Thats them all right. I cant believe it. I guess youre the only one I can trust...
Thats them all right. I cant believe it. I guess youre the only one I can trust...	... Dad.
Now, you really are my son. This calls for a celebration. Lets fire some employees.	Excellent.
Eeeeeeeeeeeee!!	Let me try one.
Hey, the trail of donuts ended. Bart!	Homer!
Ill miss you, son.	Im sorry, Dad... Youre fired!
What? Fire me? That does it, you can never be my son...	A little to the left.
Son, I know youre upset because you thought you saw us on TV saying we didnt want you in our family. But those were just actors playing us.	How do you know?
The point is the real Simpson family missed you a lot and were really glad youre home.	I love you guys.
Homer, I want that thing out of my house.	Theyre gonna eat this up at Show and Tell.
Im not sure if Im comfortable with the idea of your classmates laughing at our familys private moments. How would you like it if, twenty years from now, people were laughing at things you did?	Not likely. Cmon, have a sense of humor about yourself!
Why dont you bring this potato? Its pretty big.	Mom, youre always trying to give me potatoes. What is it with you?
Greetings, fellow geodologist.	Ill be right back.
Thank you, Nelson. I look forward to seeing it again next week. Bart, youre up.	Boys and girls, Mrs. Krabappel, I come before you today to solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries -- What has four legs and ticks?
Bart, is it a walking clock?	What? No, its my dog!
My raisin roundies!	My dogs name is Santas Little Helper. One time he crawled under the house, and when he came out he was covered with ants. Then he ran into a church and drank all the holy water.
Thats guilt. You feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job.	Yeah, I guess it is guilt.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. They let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?	Well, yeah, but --
Bart, look. Its Principal Skinner, and I think hes gone crazy. Hes not wearing a suit or tie or anything!	Principal Skinner... Um, Im real sorry about my dog getting you fired, and biting you, and then getting it on with your leg.
Bart, Ive barely been here a good solid week, and youve been sent to my office eleven times. And now that I have peanut butter cups, you seem to be gettin in trouble every hour.	Mufft a been a co-in-fa-dince.
Bart! How are you? Hows school?	Um, its, its a lot of fun.
It was? Well, then we should get together again! Uh, say Saturday, at my house. Do you know where I live?	Uh, no.
Hmmm, a flaming bag, eh? Well, these new Italian loafers will make short work of it.	Uh, Im kinda busy on Saturday.
Bum-ba-bum-bum! Ba-ba-ba-bum! Now a little more allegro than last time. Bart! Welcome! Can I offer you a Diet Caffeine-Free Dr. Pepper or an individual fruit cocktail cup?	Uh, no Ill pass. Hey, whats this?
Ned Flanders actually eliminated detention and put the whole school on the honor system?	Yeah, and the teachers are afraid to leave the faculty lounge.
Oh, that place must be falling apart. Oh, mercy. Nobodys mentioned me, have they?	Uh, I thought I heard someone say your name in the cafeteria, but they mightve been saying skim milk.
This is great. Not only am I not learnin, Im forgettin stuff I used to know. And its all thanks to you, Bart.	Yeah, great.
Whats the matter?	Dont you see, Milhouse? Weve gone too far. We need Skinner back.
Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner could become any more of a square, but theres the proof.	Its weird, Lis. I miss him as a friend, but I miss him even more as an enemy.
Actually, its exactly as I remembered it. I do want to come back, Bart, but it doesnt sound like Flanders is gonna get fired.	Oh, I think I can get him fired. I got you fired, didnt I?
...Yes. Now you realize, if I become Principal again, we can no longer be friends. Unless you become a good student.	Hmm, thats probably never gonna happen.
Well, well always have the laun-dro-mat.	Yeah.
Whats he doing here?	Well, once he found out we were going to get Ned Flanders fired, he insisted on helping.
That is true.	Heres the plan. Once Chalmers comes for his next inspection and sees how crappy the school has gotten, hell fire Ned on the spot.
Yeah, well one question remains. How do I get out of the army?	No problem-o. Just make a pass at your commanding officer.
TO-READOR EN GARDE...	Cmon, Chalmie. You fired Skinner for less than this.
Eh. He seems to know the students names.	So I guess were enemies again.
I guess. Thanks, Bart.	Sure.
Oh, sorry. This bus and I have sort of a Shining thing goin on.	Ah! This is what being a kid is all about. Hey, Huck. Whats L-I-N-C-O-N doin here?
I dunno. Its your fantasy.	Hi, Abe.
Ah, the joys of mortgaging your future.	My fantasys come true.
And to think I got all this after dropping out of the fourth grade! Ha, ha!	That does it. Im outta here.
That does it. Im outta here.	Mrs. Krabappel, I have to go to the dentist. I have a caraway seed caught under my bridgework.
Mrs. Krabappel, I have to go to the dentist. I have a caraway seed caught under my bridgework.	My moms number is on there if you want to check up on me.
I cant let the boy see me skipping work.	Good afternoon.
Hmm. His brand of gum--Doublemint. Trying to double your fun, eh, Bart? Well, Ill double your detention. I wish someone was around to hear that. And so we enter end game.	Aye carumba!
Lets see him track me now.	Oh, my God, he is like some sort of non... giving up... school guy.
And who are you, little boy?	Im one of your nephews you dont see very often. Bart-Bart.
Come back here! Im not through demeaning you.	Wow! This is the biggest Rice Krispy square Ive ever seen. Boy, the rich sure know how to live.
It says Freddy Quimby beat a waiter half to death. Those Quimby children are so wild and rich. I hope he finally gets whats coming to him.	But Freddy Quimbys innocent.
How do you know? There werent any witnesses.	Oh, yeah. Right.
Guilty.	Well they didnt, okay? They didnt! It says right here in black and white, no witnesses. Case closed. Now lets all read the funnies.
Well they didnt, okay? They didnt! It says right here in black and white, no witnesses. Case closed. Now lets all read the funnies.	Oh look, Charlie Brown said Good grief. I didnt see that comin.
Youre a witness? Bart, you have to tell the police.	I cant.
Bart Simpson, I know you cut school yesterday. And as soon as I can prove it, Im shipping you off to the Christian Military Reform School.	What he said.
Oh, good. My laundry is done.	Ya see, Lisa? They dont need my testimony.
Only because Mayor Quimbys buying his nephews freedom.	The system works. Just ask Claus Von Bulow.
Well Bart, because of you, a horrible, yet innocent person is going to jail.	Maybe I should come forward.
Your sister says you have something to tell me.	What? Uh, um, yeah. Uh, I just want to say how great it is to finally see some chicks on the bench.
Hm.	Keep up the good work, toots.
So Bart, have your insides been gnawed away by guilt, yet?	Sell it to Hallmark, sis. Youre lookin at cucumber boy. As in cool as a.
Well, Bart, your Uncle Arthur used to have a saying, Shoot em all and let God sort em out. Unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice. It took seventy-five Federal marshals to bring him down. Now, lets never speak of him again.	Mom, Mom, Mom!
Hmm?	What if I can get this guy off the hook. Sh-should I do it?
So, young man. If Freddy Quimby didnt inflict these injuries on Mr. LaCoste, just who did?	Well, I was hiding in the kitchen when it all happened...
Okay, you asked for it. Im gonna enjoy this.	And thats what really happened.
How could you have seen all this, Bart? Werent you supposed to be in school?	I sorta skipped school.
Bart, Im impressed with what you did in there. You testified for the Quimby boy even though it was putting your own head in a noose. On the other hand, you skipped school.	I guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?
Uh-oh.	Shouldnt we wait for the other babies before we open the presents?
Balsam Specific? While were burning money, why dont we give her a Curative Galvanic Belt, too?	Dont forget to give her Smecklers Powder!
WHAT KINDS OF KIDS EAT ARMOUR HOT DOGS?	FAT KIDS...
SKINNY KIDS...	KIDS WHO CLIMB ON ROCKS...
TOUGH KIDS...	SISSY KIDS...
Not a guarantee.	Ooh.
Not at all.	Ah, yes, my name is Homer Simpson, and Id like to order an Itchy an Scratchy cel. My credit card? Ah, do you accept the Federal Breast Inspectors card? License to Ogle? Viza?... Oh yes, of course, thats what I meant, Visa. Its these new dentures.
Well, Im opposed to the whole thing! Damn opposed!	Hes damn opposed! Damn! Damn! Damn opposed!
Yeah, hi! I got a special delivery for Homer Simpson.	Thats me.
Ive got a special delivery for Homer Simpson.	Um... thats me.
Homer Simpson? Ive got a uh, special delivery for ya.	Go away!
Heres your special delivery.	Thanks.
Thats for keepin me waitin!	Hey, Lis, guess whos got a genuine Itchy and Scratchy animation cel?!
It looks like part of Scratchys arm.	Oh, no. I used Dads credit card to buy this?
Yeesh. How much was it?	Three hundred fifty dollars.
This, this is a Snagglepuss drawn by Hig Heisler. It is worth something. This, this is an arm drawn by nobody. It is worth nothing.	Cant you give me anything for it?
Thats right, money. Your moneys happiness is all that moneys.	Hi. You know, Gramma really likes it when her boyfriends are nice to me. She especially likes it when they give me money.
Run along, Pee-Wee. Baby gets nothing.	Very well, you leave me no choice.
Very well, you leave me no choice.	This gun is filled with ketchup. This one with mustard. Now give me three hundred fifty bucks or youre gonna be a mess for your date.
What?!	Dont worry, heres the cash.
Woo hoo! Three hundred fifty dollars!! Now I can buy seventy transcripts of Nightline!	But Dad...
Woo hoo!	Oh well, hes happy. Im gonna keep this Mary Worth phone right here. Her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again.
Hey, Bart. You wanna go play with that x-ray machine in the abandoned hospital?	Sure!
Wheres Grampa? Wasnt he invited?	Yeah, but his reply envelope just had a check to the Gas Company in it.
How come youre not laughing? Do you think Im slow?	Buh.
And hows my little major leaguer? Catch any Junebugs today?	Well, me and Milhouse took some mail from a mail truck and threw it down the sewer.
Son, I know you meant well, but that wasnt the right thing to do.	What the hell are you talkin about? Youre the one who double dared us.
Homer!	Im outta here!
Kids, your father and I are going through a really tough time right now. And I dont know whats going to happen, but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much.	Wow, Ive never seen Mom so mad at Homer before.
Im really glad youre back, Dad. I knew you could do it. Now dont screw it up.	Look, Dad. I missed you so much, I couldnt concentrate in school and I got an F.
Hey, this is dated two weeks ago.	Oh, sorry. Heres a fresh one.
Times up?!	So long, Lis. Im gonna stow away underwater, and go where the pool goes. Have a good life.
Sorry, Bart-dude. We gotta fill this thing with Epsom salts and jam it on over to the old folks home.	Oh well. Same time tomorrow, Otto?
Bart...? Are all these children friends of yours?	Friends and well-wishers, yes.
Jump, Bart, jump! Jump, Bart, jump!	You got it.
Hey, Bart! Your epidermis is showing!	It is?!!
See, epidermis means your hair...	YAAARRRGG!!
Did I say leg? I meant that wet bathing suit. Im afraid youll need a cast on that broken bone.	Im gonna miss the whole summer.
The timing worked out great. Dont you think?	Hey, guys! Sign my cast? Sign my cast? Guys...?
Hey, guys! Sign my cast? Sign my cast? Guys...?	Milhouse!
Uh, hi, Bart.	Faithful Milhouse. Youll spend the long, hot days by my side, wont you?
I think I lost my glasses in your pool. I better go in and find them.	But youre wearing your glasses.
What fun can you have in a pool, anyway, that you cant have in a bathtub with a garbage bag taped around your cast?	Traitors. Go on and have your pool. Im fine by myself, right here.
Traitors. Go on and have your pool. Im fine by myself, right here.	You know, this isnt so bad. Ill just spend the summer getting better acquainted with an old friend called Television.
Uh, Bart...?	Dont turn on that light!!
Sorry. I just came to see how you were feeling.	Im fine. Just fine.
What are you writing here? A play?	Uh, no.
Yuh huh. Cast of Characters Viceroy Fizzlebottom, a hearty cherub of a man...	Gimme that! Its a work in progress. So. How do you like being Miss Popularity?
Look, its the telescope I won at the Optics Festival.	There was an Optics Festival and I wasnt informed? You go now.
But...	Go!
Go!	What have we here... The Lighter Side of Hippies. They dont care whose toes they step on. .
Do not be alarmed. Continue swimming naked. Aw, come on. Continue. Come on, aw. All right, Lou, open fire.	I know, Ill use this to peer into Springfields seamy underbelly.
Im never ever gonna see anything interesting with this stupid piece of junk.	That came from Flanders house.
Ohmygod! What have I done? Ive killed her!	Cant be what it looks like. This is Flanders were talkin about.
Cant be what it looks like. This is Flanders were talkin about.	Ah, Ill just watch some TV.
I wish there was some other explanation for this. But there isnt. Im a murderer! Im a murderer!	Then thats not the real Ned Flanders.
Im a murdiddly-erdiler.	If thats not Flanders, hes done his homework!
Yay!	Hes gonna kill Rod and Todd, too... Thats horrible. In principle.
I wish youd stop spreading bad rumors about people. Remember how you got Grampa tarred and feathered?	Sure. That was twenty minutes ago.
Bart, Im really sorry Ive been ignoring you lately. I got carried away with being popular. But now that Im unpopular again, I want you to know Im here for you.	You can start makin it up to me right now. Flanders is leaving the house. I want you to sneak in there and bring me back some evidence... and something sweet for later.
Bart, Im here for you but, Im not gonna break into somebodys house.	All right. Youre right, youre right. Lets-lets just forget about that. Let me read to you from my play. Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga? Is it St. Swivens day already? Tis, replied Aunt Helga.
Im goin, Im goin!	A human head!
A human head!	Of course. Oh no. Hes back. Flanders is back! Lisa, get outta there!
Of course. Oh no. Hes back. Flanders is back! Lisa, get outta there!	No, Lisa, dont go upstairs. Youll be trapped!
No, Lisa, dont go upstairs. Youll be trapped!	An axe! Hes got an axe. Ill save you, Lisa!
An axe! Hes got an axe. Ill save you, Lisa!	Uh... Ill save you by calling the police.
You have selected regicide. If you know the name of the King or Queen being murdered, press one...	Ill save you, cast or no cast!
Ill save you, cast or no cast!	Gotta save Lisa, trash can or no trash can!
Put you away for good.	Nooooo!
What the gumdrops is going on, here?	I came to stop you from murdering Lisa like you murdered your wife.
Murdered? Oh no, Ive just been in the country for a week.	But I distinctly heard you say that Maude was with God.
Oh, thats right. I was at Bible camp. I was learning how to be more judgmental.	But I saw the murder, and then I saw you bury the corpse in the backyard.
All right. Its true. I am a murderer. I over-watered Maudes favorite ficus plant, I panicked, and then I buried the remains. I was hoping to replace it before you got home.	But I heard a woman scream.
Its my room and I can do what I want.	Oh, yeah? Well, I can do what I want in my room.
Bart, quit it!	I can keep this up all day.
Youre steerin fine, boy... Hard to the right!	Oh!
Hard to the left!	Whoa!
If only this sugar were as sweet as you sir.	Homer, that was downright decent of you.
We hit the jackpot, here! White gold! Texas tea... sweetener.	Dad, isnt this stealing?
Well, youll always be number one to me...	Hell-o. First born within earshot.
Ah, that used to be my face in the mud...	I cant stand to see you so miserable, Lis, unless its from a rubber spider down your dress. Hmmm. That gives me an idea.
I cant stand to see you so miserable, Lis, unless its from a rubber spider down your dress. Hmmm. That gives me an idea.	Note for later. Put rubber spider down Lisas dress.
I appreciate the offer, but it goes against every moral fiber in my body.	Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, heres my card.
I dont need a card. You live in the room next to me.	Note Next year order fewer cards.
Why would they come to our concert just to boo us?	Lis, I did some checkin on this Allison character and I know its against all your moral fibers...
Ive got to stop being so petty. I should be Allisons friend, not her competitor. I mean, she is a wonderful person.	Way to go, Lis. I mean, why compete with someone whos just gonna kick your butt anyway?
Look, Bart. It almost killed me, but I hand-crafted all seventy-five characters from Oliver Twist. And now the coup de grace - a bitter snowstorm.	Uh oh!
Is it okay?!	Well, the important thing is that we survived.
Oh who am I kidding? Theres no way Im ever gonna beat Allison!	Well sure there is... ... but it involves being a bit underhanded, a bit devious, a bit, as the French say, Bartesque.
Ill do whatever it takes.	Then welcome to the nether regions of the soul. Now heres what we do. Tomorrow morning when Allison comes out of her house, we spray her with the hose, soaking her from head to toe, leaving us relatively dry.
Relatively?	Well, theres bound to be some splashback.
Bart, her being wet wont help me win the competition.	Well, we could just sabotage her diorama, humiliating her in front of the students and faculty.
Perfect!	Leaving her primed for the most traumatic hose-soaking of her life.
I begged you to look at mine first! I begged you!	Lisa, here is as the French say, le fake diorama. Ill create a diversion and you make the switch.
Lisa, here is as the French say, le fake diorama. Ill create a diversion and you make the switch.	Hey, everybody, whoa, look at me. Im over here. Turn this way right now.
What is it?	Its a cows heart. Theyre trying to make a monkey outta you!
Ah, at least have the guts to take the blame, girl. Youre only compounding your folly by lying about it.	Right on!
This has been a very disappointing day. All right, on to Lisa Simpson.	Youre a shoo-in now, Lis.
I can hit that one pin all right. But the rest of them dont even wobble.	You mean shining.
How many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?	Its a new episode.
Not exactly. They pieced it together from old shows, and it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth.	Really?
Yes, they do, and when was the last time you heard anyone talk about Ren and Stimpy? Children, your father and I have fed you and clothed you, but weve neglected something more important. Its time to learn about love.	No need, Mom. We already learned in school.
All you have to do is think about your most cherished memories.	Hmmm.
Hmmm.	Hello, is Al there?
Al?	Yeah, Al. Last name Caholic.
This was a wonderful idea, Homie.	What happened to Mindy?
Watch this, Lis. You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half.	A-a-a-a-and, now.
I give up. Did anybody learn anything about love tonight?	I learned it screws everybody up.
Oh, everythings too damned expensive these days. Look at this Bible I just got. Fifteen bucks! And talk about a preachy book! Everybodys a sinner except for this guy.	But now Itchy & Scratchy Land is cutting ticket prices in half. Can we go, Dad? Can we can we can we, take it, Lis.
Mom! Dad! Barts dead!	Thats right, dead serious about going to Itchy and Scratchy Land.
This year I want us to do things together as a family and get a lot of good exercise outdoors so well have a lot of wonderful memories of our vacation.	Dont worry, Mom. Well make you proud of us.
Okay, lets make a pact. This is gonna be the best vacation ever, or we all agree to disband and join other families.	Agreed.
Its money thats made just for the park. It works just like regular money, but its um, fun.	Do it, Dad.
Such a violent motif.	Yeah, but its just pretend violence, which is actually beneficial for children.
Ow!	Ow!
Homer! We just got here and already Im mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior.	I was just ordering a cheeseburger, Mom. They have violent names for everything here.
Oh look! Its the twelve noon robot parade! Hurry up or well have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.	Wow, this is so much like my dreams its scary.
Look at all this great stuff, Lis. Cool, personalized plates.	Barclay, Barry, Bert, Bort?! Aw, cmon, Bort?
Who are all these characters?	Well youre probably too young to remember the short-lived Itchy & Scratchy and Friends Hour. They had to come up with some friends. Theres Disgruntled Goat, Uncle Ant, Klu Klux Clam...
Oh yeah. They werent very funny.	I dont know, Disgruntled Goat had his moments.
I wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us?	Wanna get a snow cone?
Okay.	So, Mr. Itchy. You think youre Gods gift to women, do ya?
I just wanted to entertain!	Can you believe I keep gettin away with this... Officer?
I really wish they wouldnt scream.	Dad?
I kicked one of those stupid Itchy characters in the butt.	Yeah. Theres just no way to resist it, is there?
Just keep taking pictures.	Ill get more cameras!
Ill get more cameras!	Smashie, smashie.
I dont approve of that.	Sideshow Bob! Im only ten and I already got two mortal enemies.
Sideshow Bob! Im only ten and I already got two mortal enemies.	Hey, mouse! Say cheese. Hmm... with a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero.
Die, bad robots, die! With a dry, cool wit like that I could be an action hero.	Who wouldve thought that our visit to Itchy and Scratchy Land would turn out to be our best vacation ever.
I hope you realize now that violence on TV may be funny, but its not so funny when that violence is happening to you.	But it would be funny to someone who was watching us.
No, Mom. Hes right. Observe.	Ow!
I dont like him either Mom, but Im doing a report on local politics for my school project.	You think youre so big cause your class always gets to do projects. Well, um... Im doing a school project on, uh, fireworks!
I am gonna make it my mission to see that our friend Bob is set free!	Nooooo!!
Hello, children. Hello, Bart.	Eep.
Hmm. Bart, we cant let Bob steal the spotlight. Were gonna have to stoop to the lowest common denominator.	I can do that.
I hope that flu doesnt affect his performance out there.	Dont worry. Hes taken a million of these capsules.
Theres no Councilman Les Wynan.	Good line, though.
Bart, by special request of the Mayors office, you are going to be left back.	You mean I have to repeat the fourth grade?
Well, yes... but, not for four or five years. Bart, youre going to kindergarten.	Kindergarten?
Now boys and girls, who knows what this is?	Triangle.
Very good, Bart. You have first choice of toys for free play.	Cool! I call the Flintstone Phone!
This is so cool, Bart. Were just like Woodward and Bernstein!	Yeah, except their dad wasnt waiting in the car reading Archie comics.
Youre on the right track. Follow the names.	How the hell do you know?
This is hopeless. Theyre gonna demolish our house for sure. Were gonna have to move into a Motel 6.	But dad cant afford six dollars a night.
But dad cant afford six dollars a night.	Heyyy...
Heyyy...	Lis! Lis! Cmere! I found him! I found Edgar Neubauer!
Lis! Lis! Cmere! I found him! I found Edgar Neubauer!	Oh my God! The dead have risen and theyre voting Republican!
All right, Bob! Now its personal!!	Hey, uh, he did try to kill me...
You dont have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you?	You were just Barlows lackey!
You were Ronnie to his Nancy!	Sonny to his Cher!
There! Is that what you want, you smarmy little bastards?!	We want the truth!
Boy, you read my thoughts! Youve got the shinning.	Aww. Tomorrow we were gonna find out who the dish ran away with.
The spoon, Bart.	Of course!
Hmm, thats odd. Usually the blood gets off at the second floor.	Hey, I found a short cut through your hedgemaze.
Now, now. Go easy on the wee one. His fathers gonna go crazy and chop them all into haggis.	Whats haggis?
No answer.	Dont worry, Mom. I can use my shinning to call Willie.
Live from Broadway, its the Tony Awards! With your hosts, Tyne Daly and Hal Linden.	Homer, change channel!
Oh, I see by the big board weve got a Negative Nellie in Sector Two. Im afraid Im going to have to ask the whole family to kinda freeze and prepare for re-Neducation.	Dont you remember, Dad? Flanders is the unquestioned lord and master of the world.
Look. Oooo, hello. Hello there. Whos that big man there? Whos da?	Join us, Father.
Hey, where is everybody?	Hey, theres a bug that looks like dad. Lets kill it.
I mean, Heeeyy.	Good morning, father dear. Hope youre well.
Are you saying you killed Jimbo, processed his carcass, and served him for lunch?	Hmm, I wonder where Jimbo is today. He shouldve beaten us up for our lunch money an hour ago.
Listen, kids. Youre eight and ten years old now. I cant be fighting all your battles for you.	But Mom!
Relax, honey. You were just having a crazy nightmare. Youre back with your family now, where theres nothing to be afraid of -- except that fog that turns people inside out.	Huh?
Remember Bart, I mean, Dances in Underwear, we take the white man alive.	All right, Thinks Too Much, it shall be so.
I got twosies!	Thats not fair, Nelson. They didnt have the Killmatic 3,000 back then.
And with flaming swords the Aramites did pierce the eyes of their fellow men and did feast on what flowed forth. Among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lust of or flesh...	IM A TROLL MAN / DA DA DA DA DA DA DA/ IM A TROLL MAN...
Bye, b-bye, b-bye... Thank you for choosing our church... B-Bye...	Ive never felt this way about a girl before. My long search is finally over.
Ive never felt this way about a girl before. My long search is finally over.	Hi. Im Bart Simpson. I was incredibly moved by your reading. I dont think Gods words have ever sounded so plausible.
Dont be so hard on yourself, Bart. Its not your fault Jessica doesnt like you.	Is it my hair? My overbite? The fact that Ive worn the same clothes, day in, day out, for the last four years?
Bart Simpson?	Yes Maam. Id like to return to your wonderful Sunday school, please.
Oh dear.	You know, the great thing about Sunday school is were finally learning something we can use.
Yeah, so true. I have to turn my chair this way now.	Somehow I gotta convince her Im a good person. All right, I have to sit here and behave no matter what.
Okay, class. We have a special treat today for pass-around -- a replica of the slingshot David used to slay Goliath... While you kids are looking at that, Ill just busy myself in this file cabinet.	Must... fight... Satan. Make it... up to him... later.
Must... fight... Satan. Make it... up to him... later.	You know I was considering staying after school and helping teacher clean up.
Do you ever think anything you dont say?	There is just no pleasing a girl like that. All that unnecessary behaving... Im all tensed through the chestal area. I need relief.
Ah, tis no more than what God gave me, you Puritan pukes!	Thatll hold me. At least til I get my hands on some kind of explosives.
Theres not? You used me Skinner! You used me!	Three months .
Wanna have dinner at my house tonight?	Really? Uh, sure.
Great. We eat at seven.	Theres only one thing to do at a moment like this... strut.
So Bart, hows school going? Jessica always gets straight As.	Well, in my family, grades arent that important. Its what you learn that counts.
Hm, I didnt know the rocket sled was an Olympic event.	Well no offense, lady, but what you dont know could fill a warehouse.
Young man, explain yourself.	Sorry, I have kind of a short fuse, which some find charming. Speaking of charming, watching Fox last night, I heard a rather amusing story... This character named Martin was feeling rather randy and he was heard to remark...
And dont you ever come near my daughter again! Never have I heard such gratuitous use of the word butt.	But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but...
Make him stop! Make him stop!	O-kay.
Yes you are. Youre bad, and I like it.	Im bad to the bone, honey.
Lets go find some fun.	But your father said...
Oh, I told the Rev I was going to my room to say my prayers.	Smart, beautiful, and a liar! So much better than that Sarah, plain and tall.
No way would a ministers daughter go out with you.	Oh yeah? Ill prove it.
Oh yeah? Ill prove it.	Hey, Jessica.
Yes? Am I supposed to know you?	Jessica we just...
Thats for besmirching an innocent girls name!	Why?
Im sorry, Bart -- you know my parents cant find out about us. And besides, if its secret, its even more exciting.	I guess.
Hey, you want to go skateboarding?	Um, actually, I was hoping I could sit down for just a second.
Come on, itll be fun.	Wow. Now I have the energy to do anything!
Wow. Now I have the energy to do anything!	Just give me two minutes.
Bart, you cant trust your perception at this altitude.	Actually, if the road surface maintains its integrity, I just might be able to hold on.
No. That glue aint goin nowhere.	Nothins ever gonna stop me.
Ah, no. There goes the glue, after all!	Nooooo!
Hi.	Uh, we should get to class.
Whats the hurry?	We could get in trouble for being late.
I cant believe it, Bart. Id always thought Jessica was so sweet.	Shes like a Milk Dud, Lis. Sweet on the outside, poison on the inside.
You gotta give her up.	No, no, wait. Hear my plan. I put up with her for seven more years. Then, well get married. Once the first baby comes along, shes bound to settle down and start treatin me right. After all, I deserve it.
Well read and just a little wild. If only someone could tame him.	Youre right, Lisa -- love isnt about fixing someone. Im just going to give her up cold turkey. Im not gonna talk to her or see her. Its over. Thanks for the advice, sis.
Bart, be strong. You dont need that little hell cat.	Oh Lis, shes already drawing me to her with her beautiful siren song.
Oh Lis, shes already drawing me to her with her beautiful siren song.	Thats very disturbing.
Hey, Bart. What? Whats wrong?	Well, Jessica, I dont think we should hang out together anymore. Youre turning me into a criminal when all I want to be is a petty thug.
Youre right about everything, Bart. I have been too reckless. From now on I am going to settle down.	Jessica, what are you doing!
It takes money to start a new life.	But stealing from the collection basket is really wrong. Even I know that.
The collection money is gone! / That awful boy must have stolen it!	I...
Son, if you can look me in the eye and say you didnt take the collection money, thats all I need.	I didnt take it.
Bart honey, do you know who did take the money?	No.
Listen, thanks for not turning me in. That was sweet.	Well, it seems like if you really care for me, you should come forward.
Oh, dont you see? Its because I care for you that I cant come forward.	That doesnt make any sense.
All right, then I just dont feel like it, okay?	Jessica, youre really beautiful, but you are not very nice.
Duh.	You know, with the way youre treating me, why should I protect you?
Because if you tell, no one will believe you. Remember, Im the sweet, perfect ministers daughter and youre just yellow trash.	Huh?
So heres where youre hiding.	Yeah. This is my only refuge from the taunts and accusations of the townspeople.
I won! I won!	Give it up, Lis. Shes a criminal mastermind. Shes got a 108 IQ, she reads at a fifth grade level, and her hair smells like red Fruit Loops.
Uh, I think you all owe my son an apology.	Thats okay. Preciate it... Mm Hmm.
Hi Bart, come to watch me suffer?	I just wanted to let you know that even though this was a difficult experience, I really learned a lot... Im a little wiser and a little less naÃ¯ve.
Well, I learned that I can make men do whatever I want.	Well, dont you see, Jessica, then you really havent learned --
Um, would you finish scrubbing these steps for me?	Will I!
Coming.	Poor sucker. Its amazing what some guys will do for a pretty face. Not me though. Waitll she sees the second rate job I do on these stairs. .
Its Channel Six Action News!	Ah, Action News, the last place an impressionable kid can go for TV violence.
Oh my God! Damn you, snow!	All right, snow day! No school tomorrow!
That doesnt mean you dont have to do your book report. What if the weatherman is wrong?	Lisa, that man is a professional meteorologist.
Youre gonna eat a blizzard of...	Unseasonable warmth...?
Nice p.j.s, Simpson! Did your Mommy buy them for you?	Of course she did. Who else would have?
Okay, its book report time! Well do them alphabetically. Today its A through M.	Im saved! I love being a S-s-s-simpson!
Lets see, we have no As, so lets go right to the Bs. Bart?	Huh?!
Ha!!	Mrs. Krabappel, I didnt...
Whew, thats all of em. And Im so proud you didnt try to forge my name. How bout a present, son?	Well, I could use a new pair of hockey skates.
Okay, son, just remember to have fun out there today, and if you lose, Ill kill you.	...Dad.
Well boy, you won. So Im gonna live up to my side of the agreement. Heres your turtle, alive and well.	Aw thanks, Dad.
Aw thanks, Dad.	How about some adulation from my lil sister?
Wow Bart, Im so impressed you were able to give Milhouse a concussion.	Ah, youre just jealous...
Ah, youre just jealous...	Because - you - stink - at - sports...
Well, I think women should be able to play any sport men play, but hockey is so violent and dangerous. Look at Milhouses teeth.	Mom, will you stop showin us those?
Hey, Bart, if Lisa is better than you at hockey, does that mean youre gonna become better than her at school?	Maybe I will, Milhouse, maybe I will.
Bart Simpson... Bart Simpson... Bart Simpson... Bart Simpson, will you stop raising your hand?! You havent had one right answer all day.	Sorry.
Bart, I can spend some time with you.	I dunno, Mom.
Hey, watch out for the Shaq-attack!	Ow.
Ma. I think Im all hugged out. Oh... one more.	Hello, queen Lisa.
Bart, what are you doing in my room?	Lisa, certain differences, rivalries, if you will, have come up between us. At first I thought we can talk it over like civilized people. But instead, I just ripped the head off Mr. Honeybunny.
Bart, that was your cherished childhood toy.	Mr. Honeybunny!
Bart, just get out of here.	Hey! Its a free country. You get out.
That doesnt make sense.	I know you are, but what am I?
Get out! Get out!	Okay, but on my way, Im gonna be doing this.
Okay, but on my way, Im gonna be doing this.	If you get hit, its your own fault.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!	Mom, that is really annoying.
Bart started it.	Uh uh, Lisa started it.
What? What? A bartender cant come by and say hi to his best customer? Hey, hey there, Midge! Oh gee I like what you done to your hair.	You go, Mom. For the greater good.
Dont worry, Im wearing my lucky rabbits head.	Mr. Honeybunny! You inhuman monster!
Homer, we cant root for one child over the other. You wouldnt like it if the kids played favorites with us.	Hey, Mom! Look at me, Mom!
Kill Bart! Kill Bart! Kill Bart!	Great game, Lis.
Hey, hey, hey! I have asked you nicely not to mangle my merchandise. You leave me no choice but to ask you nicely again.	CanIcometothecandyshow!?CanIcome!? CanIcome!?
Well, thats the babysitter. No one in town will sit for you two anymore. I had to choose between a grad student at the university and a scary-looking hobo.	Please the hobo. Please the hobo. Please the hobo.
Ashley Grant! You gave a talk on womens issues at my school on how we dont have to be second class citizens.	Mom! How can you leave us with this maniac?!
Well theres also a baby somewhere upstairs!	So, youre one of those dont call me a chick chicks, huh?
Oh, I dont know. See this, Bart?	Disemboweler 4, the game where condemned criminals dig at each other with rusty hooks.
Mmm hmm. Do a little housework, and you can play for five minutes.	No waaaay. Gg-aah... Yesm.
See, Lisa? Males arent hard to tame. They all follow their video cartridges.	Ow.
Well Lisa, remember that post card Grampa sent us from Florida of that alligator biting that womans bottom?	Oh, yeah. That was brilliant.
Thats right, we all thought it was hilarious. But it turns out we were wrong. That alligator was sexually harassing that woman.	And the dog in the Coppertone ad? Same deal, Dad?
Well, thats kind of a gray area.	We know youre innocent, Dad.
Sorry, Dad. We do believe in you. We really do.	Its just hard not to listen to TV. Its spent so much more time raising us than you have.
In our mad pursuit of a scoop, we members of the press sometimes make mistakes. Rock Bottom would like to make the following corrections	Wow. V8 juice isnt one-eighth gasoline.
Dont turn on the light! Dont turn on the light!	Theres a U.F.O. outside my window!! Seriously!
Oh, Bart. Its just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree.	C-c-can I sleep in there with you guys tonight?
No!	Can I sit on the roof with a baseball bat in case a U.F.O. does come?
Shh. I dont want people to see us looking at these books.	Hi, guys. Whatcha lookin at?
Yeah, I hope its as exciting as his other book Rational Thinking Reasonable Future!	Im getting this book on U.F.O.s.
Im getting this book on U.F.O.s.	Did you know theyre real, but theres a huge government conspiracy to cover it up?
What do you think Mom and Dad are doing right now?	Iunno.
Who cares? With no adults around, I run this city! Er, carry on.	Listen to this. Unexplainable Behavior. Individuals acting in a secretive fashion are often involved with UFOs, or other paranormal phenomena, e.g. telephone explosions.
Geez! If its in a book, its gotta be true!	Scary, no? And this guys head of the Spaceology Department at the Correspondence College of Tampa!
Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it! Why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions? Havent you heard of Occams Razor? The simplest explanation is probably the correct one.	So whats the simplest explanation?
Okay, heres what weve got. The Rand Corporation, in conjunction with the saucer people...	Thank you.
Son! My dear Son. From now on Im going to be a good and attentive father. And for starters your old man is gonna teach you how to ride... your very first bike!	Dad, number one I know how to ride a bike. Number two I already own a bike. And number three that is a girls bike.
No! No! No! No!!!	No offense, Homer, but your half-assed under-parenting was a lot more fun than your half-assed over-parenting.
Some day youll thank me for all this scary love! But now, Ive gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking.	Im sure he meant to say serious drinking.
Cant.	Okay.
Yes. Cris-a-tunity. Youre right! Ive been wasting my life away in that dump for years. Thats it. Im going to find a new bar to drink in. And Im gonna get drunker than Ive been in my entire life! Bart, wheres my wallet?	Right here, Dad.
Good news, everybody. Because I endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want.	Alaska!
Oh, I forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer. If someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a fire.	Oh, great. I specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby.
Cmon, Bart. Theyre gonna pamper us. Not literally, of course.	I come for the service, but I stay for the leg room.
Permit me to solve the mystery. Your mother has a fear of flying.	So much for the days when I could say at least my mothers normal.
Hope I do.	I dont believe it! Principal Skinner!
I dont believe it! Principal Skinner!	Well, well, well. I never thought Id win this easy.
Bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down.	Okay.
So anyway, Lenny and Carl are never around on Wednesdays. And they dont tell me where they go. Its like a conspiracy.	A conspiracy, eh? You think they might be involved in the Kennedy assassination in some way?
Kids can be so cruel.	We can? Thanks, Mom.
Im a Stonecutter.	Dad, remember those self-hypnosis classes we took to help us ignore Grampa?
Certainly.	Maybe we should be listening to him now.
Or an inlet.	Or a fjord.
Homer, you promised. One night of family time a week. Besides, that back-talking boat sets a bad example.	Says you, woman.
And heres our TV next to the mirror. It looks like we have two.	Wow. Two.
Thats exciting.	Oh please.
It all began about two years ago, before Maggie was even born. Bart, you were Lisas age and Lisa you were the age Bart was several years ago.	Get the camera ready, Bart very seepy.
So in a few months both of you will have a brand new brother or sister.	Been there, done that.
I hope its a girl.	You know nothin about genetics, Lis. It goes boy, girl, boy, girl.
New job?... Marge is pregnant?! Nooooo!	Wow, Dad. You really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?
Well who wouldnt be upset? That new baby in your mothers womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from Sunday! Hey, wherere you going?	Dad, you cant expect a person to sit for thirty minutes straight.
Yeah.	Okay, but I know funny.
Absolutely.	Then why no pictures?
And now, to top off our most propane-explosion-free Science Week ever, our grand finale! The launching of a weather balloon.	Yay! Go weather balloon! Hurrah for science! Woo!
Nooooooo!	I dont think I really captured the eyes.
Bart? Empty your pockets.	And youve never found anything?
And youve never found anything?	Empty my pockets you say? Well, certainly, but I fail to see how...
Hmmm... blueprints of the dummy, ... notarized photos of you making the dummy... and an alternate wording for the banner Buttzilla.	Race you to Utah, Milhouse.
Because you have impeded science, you must now aid science. Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will assist me with my amateur astronomy. Taking down coordinates, carrying equipment and so forth. Four-thirty in the morning.	Theres a four-thirty in the morning now?
Top of the hour. Time for the morning news. But, of course, there is no news yet. Everyones still asleep. In their comfy, comfy beds. Good night everybody.	Mom, will you make me breakfast?
Come home, Lassie! Here boy! Cmon girl! Atta boy!	Still dark. Better use the generator.
Ah, theres nothing more exciting than science. You get all the fun of sitting still, being quiet, writing down numbers, paying attention... Science has it all!	Is that the telescope were gonna be looking through?
Theres Orion... the Swan...the chariot race...	Why dont they look anything like their names?
Well, you do have to use your imagination. Look, theres the Three Wise Men.	Who names these things anyway?
Once. But by the time I got to a phone, my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kohoutek. I got back at him though. Him and that little boy of his. Anyway... thats why I always keep a cellular phone next to me. Now, this morning were gonna be mapping a small square of sky thats thought to be empty. Its my hope that its not.	So what am I supposed to do exactly?
Just write down my findings as I give them to you. Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-two minutes declination... No sighting.	Uh huh.
Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-three minutes declination... No sighting.	Uh huh.
Six hours, nineteen minutes right ascension, fourteen degrees fifty-eight minutes declination... No sighting. Did you get that one, Bart?	Hell no.
Its coming pretty close to the ground. Maybe I can catch it. Dont touch the telescope, Bart. Even a slight change in elevation can destroy a whole mornings work.	Woo! All hands on deck! Pirates off the port bow! Hey!
Woo! All hands on deck! Pirates off the port bow! Hey!	Observatory? This is Bart Simpson. I see something in the sky at... four, twelve, eight, and the last number is seven.
What did you do today, Bart?	What didnt I do.
A young Springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known as The Bart Simpson Comet. Oh honey, Im so proud of you.	But then, youve always been proud of me.
Wont you join us, Bart?	Uh... I guess so.
As the first student at Springfield Elementary to discover a comet, were very proud to make you a member of our very select group. Welcome to SuperFriends!	Huh?
I am called Ham, since I enjoy ham radio. This is E-Mail, Cosine, Report Card, Database and Lisa. Your nickname will be Cosmos.	Well Im done eating. Goodbye.
Perhaps some night you could show us your comet.	There it is right there.
I make it a point never to turn my head unless I expect to see something, Bart. Naturally we cant see your comet in broad daylight and without a telescope.	But you dont need a stupid telescope. Its right there.
It must be coming toward us at a fantastic speed.	Huh?
Dont you realize whats happening, Bart? Your comet is gonna collide with the earth and every living thing in its path will be killed.	I knew youd try to find something wrong with my comet Lisa. Youve always been petty and small. Right from the beginning.
We are the SuperFriends...	Hey, shut up.
Well then, I have a back-up plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going doo-doo-doo-dee-doo-do-doo...	Dad, the plan!
Im getting to that. So anyway, theyre going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo...	Dad!
It blew up the bridge!	Were doomed!
Whats everyone so worked up about? So theres a comet. Big deal. Itll burn up in our atmosphere, and whatsever left will be no bigger than a chihuahuas head.	Wow, Dad. Maybe youre right.
Its a pig!	Its a cow, man.
Its breaking up!	Cool!
I cant believe that extra thick layer of pollution that Ive actually picketed against is what burned up the comet.	Whats really amazing is that this is exactly what Dad said would happen.
When Krusty wants to he can still blow em away.	Yes. He can take a simple, everyday thing like eating a bicycle and make it funny.
Thats it! You people have stood in my way long enough. Im going to clown college!	I dont think any of us expected him to say that.
Hold still, Homer. Dont squirm.	Dad, you cant just go around pretending to be Krusty. Its sacrilege. Hes a one and only. I mean, he invented the pie fight, the prat fall, and the seltzer bottle... as far as I know.
You werent complaining when I got you this close to Chachi.	Whats a Chachi?
Well, I guess youre pretty impressed, huh Bart? My dad got Krusty the Klown to personally appear at my party.	I have a feeling I could get him to appear at my house.
Hey, Krusty! Hey, ooh, beautiful date tonight! And such lovely children you have now!	Im more striking than lovely.
Im seeing double here. Four Krustys.	Payroll. Burt Stanton speaking.
And two, your change. And we thank you.	Go, toothpaste! Go! Move your pasty white butt!
It never spins the other way. In the Northern hemisphere, water always drains counter-clockwise. Its called the Coriolis effect.	No way. Water doesnt obey your rules. It goes where it wants. Like me, babe.
Yes, Bart. Why dont you try it and see?	I know Ive seen it go the other way. Ah, faithful toilet. Youll prove me right.
Bart, water will only go the other way in the Southern Hemisphere.	What the hell is the Southern Hemisphere?
See, the Southern Hemisphere is made up of everything below the Equa... this line.	Hmm, so down there in, say, Argentina or Rand-McNally all their water runs backwards?
Uh-huh. In fact, in Rand-McNally, they wear hats on their feet, and hamburgers eat people.	Cool.
Please to repeat again and I will translating for the El Presidente.	Which way does the water turn in your toilet?
Bart, you cant actually call these places! Dont you know how expensive international calls are?	Hello, operator? Id like to make a collect call to...
Hello, operator? Id like to make a collect call to...	Australia.
This is the international operator. Will you accept a collect call from...	Er, uh, this is Dr. Bart Simpson of the International Drainage Commission. Its an emergency.
If its an emergency, then.	We understand some drains in your area have been malfunctioning, sucking in people and what-not.
Whillikers! Thats orful!	Indeed. We need you to check your sinks and toilets and tell us which way the water is going. And, please -- stand clear!
Hey, Bart! The bakery caught fire and all of downtown smells like cookies! Wanna go smell?	Yes. Yes I do.
Hullo? Sir? Sir?	Huh?
Ive returned from the Koolamuggerys place. Theyre draining clockways, too.	Draining? Oh, I dont care about that anymore.
Oh my God, theres nothing wrong with the bidet, is there?	Yello?
Right, Im calling all the way from Squatters Crag, Australia, and I want to speak to a Dr. Bart Simpson right now!	Uhh... Hold please.
Oy! I said Bart Simpson! What kind of a company is th--	Bart Simpsons office.
Well thank the great good lord. Look, I was just--	One moment, please.
Who do they think I am? Some stupid Aussie drongo? Bleedin Yanks, I oughta --	This is Bart Simpson. Can I help you, Maam?
Hey! My name is Bruno Drundridge, right? You owe me nine hundred dollars, mate!	No. You owe me nine hundred dollars.
Youre just some punk kid, arent you? Ooh, you picked the wrong guy to tangle with here, mate!	I dont think so. Youre all the way in Australia. Hey, I think I hear a dingo eatin your baby.
Office of the Solicitor General? Office of the Prime Minister? Hopping Mad Collection Agency? What is all this stuff?	Nothing. Some stupid country thinks I owe them money.
Uh-oh. Bart, you better talk to Mom and Dad about this.	Hey, guys, just so you dont hear any wild rumors... Im being indicted for fraud in Australia.
Bart, did you trick an Australian boy into accepting a nine hundred dollar collect call?	Yesm.
All Bart has to do is apologize, and we get a free trip to Australia?	I can handle that. Im an expert at phony apologies.
Bart!	Im sorry.
It says you cant bring in outside plants or animals. Any foreign creature you bring in could upset the environmental balance.	Oh.
Oh.	Sorry, girl. I dont wanna get in any more trouble down here.
Sorry, girl. I dont wanna get in any more trouble down here.	Ill pick you up on the way home.
Oh, yeah, this is the life. Boy, next summer, can you commit some fraud in Orlando, Florida?	Im way ahead of ya, Dad.
Hello. Now, everything is all set for Barts apology. Mr. Conover will meet you at the Parliament House at three P.M. Any questions?	Yeah. Do the toilets go backwards in here?
Australia! America! Austr--	I get it, Dad.
You call that a knife. This is a knife.	Thats not a knife. Thats a spoon.
I believe he has something to say. Bart?	Im sorry. Im sorry for what I did to your country.
Oh, its just a little kick in the bum.	Yuh-oh.
Hey! We can get away in their pouches!	Ewww. Its not like in cartoons.
What? Ats an odd name. Ida called them chuzz-wuzzers.	Liiiiisa!
No deal! This is my son were talking about. Sure hes not perfect, but who is in this work-a-day world?	No, Mom... Wait. Its time for me to bend over and receive my destiny.
Thats it, lad. This is for the Commonwealth of Australia.	And this is for the United States of America.
Hey, do we get to land on an aircraft carrier?	So, uh, whats your hurry to get to school?
And who could forget dear Rat boy?	Rat boy? I resent that.
Thats enough, Bart. Fun is fun but if were late were gonna get in trouble.	Youre right, Milhouse. Fun is fun.
Did you hear that, Bart? That was the tardy bell. Truant! Truant! Truant! theyll all say!	Aw, who needs him. I can have fun all by myself.
Aw, who needs him. I can have fun all by myself.	Sallright?
Sallright.	Sallright?
Sallright.	Sallright?
There is only one class left, but it happens to be the coolest one of all.	Ballet? Dancin is for girls!
Ah, and what have we here? A young man, maybe, who thinks he can be the next Baryshnikov?	I dont want to be the next anything. Im only taking this stupid class because they made me.
So, he has fire in the belly. But it will take more than belly-fire to be the next Baryshnikov!	Look, Boris. I think ballets for sissies.
Is something wrong, Mr. Simpson?	I dont like wearing tights, maam.
But so many of your heroes wear tights. Batman, for example. And Magellan.	Look, I dont like this cootie platoon and I never will. Im outta here and Im out of this stupid outfit.
Look, I dont like this cootie platoon and I never will. Im outta here and Im out of this stupid outfit.	Wait! Joy of movement increasing... Love of dance, impossible to resist... Toes twinkling... Look at me, girls. Im doing ballet...and I love it!
Bravissimo, Bart. Next week, class gives its first recital. And you... you will dance the male lead.	Dance in front of my whole school? What is it with you and ballet?
I know you have great conflict, Bart. You love ballet, yet you fear the boys will laugh at you. No?	No, I fear the girls will laugh at me. I fear the boys will beat the living snot out of me.
Youre gonna have to work hard to win this crowd over. Most of them are here as part of detention.	Pretty big crowd.
Sure, sure we had. Of course, we was caves, but every cave had a national anthem. Ill never forget my caves national anthem.	Dang.
I havent been moved like this since The Joy Luck Club.	Behold, the masked dancer is me, Bart.
Behold, the masked dancer is me, Bart.	It is I who have won your acclaim!
Haw-haw!	Go ahead and laugh. But I took a chance and did something I wanted to do. And if that makes me a sissy, well then, I guess Im a sissy.
Bart, I am so proud of you. You showed a sensitive side of yourself that can never be erased. From this day forward we are kindred spirits.	Why did she just leave me here when I clearly need medical attention?
I think we should call a town meeting. If we dont do something soon, we wont get any tourists at all.	No tourists? Ill be ruined.
No tourists? Ill be ruined.	Maps to movie stars homes! Mapa por las casas de las cineastas! Top-u stah noh cheezu map-u!
So we propose changing our name from Springfield to Seinfeld.	I may be just a boy, but I have an idea. If I may, Id like to show you a few slides.
I may be just a boy, but I have an idea. If I may, Id like to show you a few slides.	Heres Springfield as it appears from space. Somewhere in this windy valley is the Lost Dutchmans Mine.
Young man, that appears to be a picture of your rear end.	So long, suckers!
So long, suckers!	This is the last time I use a plan devised by Milhouse.
And... action!	Hello, Im Bart Simpson. In the past, Ive brought you such classic films as Homer in the Shower, and Homer on the Toilet. And now, I give you... The Eternal Struggle.
Coming up next The Flintstones Meet the Jetsons.	Uh oh. I smell another cheap cartoon crossover.
Hello.	Hey man, I really love your show. I think all kids should watch it. I suddenly feel so dirty.
Next, theyre gonna show my movie.	You made a movie?
And if you ever want to visit my show...	Nah, were not gonna be doing that.
Please call a doctor.	Oh, these Renaissance Faires are so boring.
Oh really? Did you see the loom? I took Loom in High School.	Meh.
Hi, Mom. Aw, thats great news about Lisa. Well listen, Id better get to get back to work.	Heh, heh. Theyre finally paying me for this.
Heh, heh. Theyre finally paying me for this.	Oh yeah!
Oh, right.	Anyway, Hugh, theres more to my life than just a wrecking ball. I also crush cars into cubes. And on the side, I promote local tough man contests. Basically Im gettin out all my aggression til I go to law school.
...to wear... those... things.	Ow! Hey watch those virtual darts. Im trying to play virtual pool!
Hugh didnt have a bachelor party.	We had one in his honor. I had one in his honor. I went to a strip club.
Who spread garbage all over Flanders yard before I got a chance to?	Oh, please! This is senseless destruction, with none of my usual social commentary.
My Bongo drums!	My strobe light!
You got it.	Hey!
And theyre in the home stretch. Its -- wait! Another dog is on the track!	Its Santas Little Helper!
Uh-oh...	It looks like hes trying to jump over her, but he cant quite make it. Come on, boy, you can do it!
Take it, it fell on the floor-a.	Hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?
Hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?	Me and Santas Little Helper used to be a team, but he never wants to play anymore since his bitch moved in!
Bart! Dont ever say that word again!	Well thats what she is! I looked it up.
Well, Im going to write the dictionary people and have that checked. It feels like a mistake to me.	Hey look! A really small dog just fell out of Santas girlfriend.
Now its two sets of twins.	Two sets of twins and a triplet!
How many more can there be?	Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four...
Twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four...	Twenty-five.
Wow! Twenty-five puppies!	An army of dogs! No bully will ever touch me again!
An army of dogs! No bully will ever touch me again!	Hey, jerkface! You have the face of a jerk!
All right, Simpson, you asked for...	Get em, boys!
Get em, boys!	Say, Jimbo ... hope I wasnt out of line with that jerkface crack.
Now I know we love the puppies very much, but I think theyre getting to be a problem.	Yeah, they ate all my socks! I have to wear Lisas to school today!
How do you explain the culottes, boy?	Well, I have to coordinate, dont I?
Bart!	Sorry. Youve gotta admit its catchy.
Come on, Smithers. Lets go finish the little flea circuses off. Except for Little Monty, of course.	Weve gotta get the dogs outta there!
Ssh.	Hush, puppies!
Weve gotta get you outta here!	I know, the window!
No Bart! Whatre you doing?	Dogs always land on their feet.
Thats cats.	No, its dogs. Ill prove it.
No, its dogs. Ill prove it.	Best two out of three.
Bart, Look! A laundry chute!	Okay guys, lets move!
Okay guys, lets move!	Come on! Come on!
Ive got an idea!	Sorry, Monty, but youre too big for this ride.
Give me that! Now if youll excuse us, children, the pups have a date with a fashion knife.	There! Now you dont know which one is Little Monty! I guess if you dont want him to be part of your tuxedo, youll have to let the other dogs go, too!
This bus has seen better days.	Well, at least its safer than the old bus.
... And the Springfielders heroically slaughtered their enemies as they prayed for mercy.	Its hard to see whats going on. I can only make out the fat soldiers.
Ive never seen them fight like that, Bart. Im worried that all this posturing and saber-rattling could lead to a teachers strike.	Strike, eh?
Strike, eh?	Oww! My bones are so brittle. But I always drink plenty of... malk?
Go away, Bart. This is not a good time.	I saw you two fighting. Im worried there could be a strike and the school would shut down.
Skinner said that?	Well, I had to clean it up a little.
She did?	Yeah. She said youd fold faster than Superman on laundry day.
Well see about that. Simpson, I always thought you were sneaky and manipulative, but now I see youre really a very sensitive little boy.	Thank you, sir.
Bart! Lisa! What are you two doing home so early?	Great news, Mom!
Horrible news, Mom!	The schools on strike. Maybe forever. Overload. Pleasure overload.
Awesome.	You with the crane, spin around real fast.
You with the crane, spin around real fast.	Now you, dump three tons of sand onto that port-a-potty.
Now for operation strike-make-go-longer.	You know, I heard Skinner say the teachers will crack any minute.
Yay, recess!	Milhouse, I found a hive of killer bees. You wanna go throw rocks at it?
Sorry Bart, Im deeply immersed in the Teapot Dome Scandal.	Huh?
However, it might be feasible in a fortnight.	Wuh?
I can play in two weeks.	Juh?
And Bart isnt doing very well either. He needs boundaries, and structure. Theres something about flying a kite at night thats so unwholesome.	Hello, mother dear.
Wow Bart, Im impressed the way you knocked off all those substitutes.	In my weaker moments I almost pity them. Then I just remind myself theyre trying to teach.
So, how was everybodys day at school?	Horrifying.
Marge, anyone can miss Canada... all tucked away down there.	Mrs. Krabappel, Im done failing the test. Can I please go to the nurse?
Well, Ive had just about enough of your Vassar bashing young lady.	Look Mom, it feels really weird having you on my turf. How would you feel if I started moppin the floor?
And Im gonna keep teaching your class. Like it or lump it.	Well, then. I guess Ill just have to get into the crawl space again.
Psst. Over here.	Mom, I need a dollar. Ever since you started teaching here, kids have been taking my lunch money. And I need that money for candy.
Here ya go, precious.	Why isnt my mom stopping this?
Yeah.	Thats it. I cant take this anymore, Milhouse. Ive gotta get the real teachers back.
Oh, this is wonderful! Youre alive!	Zuh? Wait, thats it! With your book smarts and my ability to exploit people with book smarts, we can figure out a clever plan to get them back together.
Let us out, Bart! / This is not funny, come on! / Bart, let us out right now!	Dont worry, theyll start negotiating.
Psst, kid. Help me break out of here, Ill totally make it worth your while.	Im listening...
Bart, are you ready for your history test?	Oh you bet, Mom. Ask me anything.
OK. Who was George Washington Carver?	Um, the guy who chopped up George Washington?
Bart, you said you were going to study.	Oh, my stomach!
You just dont want to take that test.	No I mean it. It really hurts!
Well thats a lame excuse for an excuse. Ha!	Look, if you ignore me and I die, youd get in a lot of trouble.
Read page six of the school charter.	No teacher shall be held accountable if Bart Simpson dies.
Bonjour, you cheese eatin surrender monkeys.	Look, my stomach really hurts.
My brother just had his appendix out.	Hello, Im Dr. Cheeks. Im doing my rounds and uh, Im a little behind.
Hey, Lisa. Are you still upset about that jazz guy?	If it helps, I believe that after you die, you can come back as whatever you want. Ill be a butterfly.
How come?	Because nobody ever suspects the butterfly.
Good news, Bart! The Krusty-O Cereal Corp. has settled your case for one hundred thousand dollars... less, of course, my legal fees.	What kind of legal fees?
Ronald Chaporo, trial attorney. Albert Dershman, who can hold three billiard balls in his mouth.	How much of the hundred thou do I get?
How much of the hundred thou do I get?	Five hundred dollars!
Yes, well, er...	Cool!
Glad youre happy. Lets roll.	I cant believe it! Five hundred bucks! Just think what I can do with that money!
I cant believe it! Five hundred bucks! Just think what I can do with that money!	Five hundred dollars on red.
The winner is black.	Cool.
Behold... the ultimate POG.	Ill take it!
Lisa, look what Ive got!	Ta-daa!
Bart! I cant believe it... But why?	When I said my stomach hurt, you were the only one who believed me.
Oh thank you. But five hundred dollars! Youll never see that much money again!	Oh yeah? Take a look at this
Hey Mom, is this how you caught him?	Lisa, please, youre too puny to --
Nothing. Im just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.	Cool -- will you bring me along when you do evictions?
I suppose I would.	What if they shot at a coke machine?
No.	TV?
No.	TV with a picture of the mayor on it?
Bart, its illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet.	But Mom--
This paddings so easy on the knuckles. I could punch all day.	Ugh!
I tried.	Wet cement! Is there any sweeter sign? Well, maybe High Voltage.
Hello son, you want to try this flying motorcycle I just invented?	No time.
Okay.	This is for the ages.
Say, lets bring him back to life by using technology.	Ay caramba!
He will be our new God.	Aah. Oh, good, somebodys shadow. Ill just turn and brag about my work.
Bart, youve graffito-tagged public property.	It was an accident.
I cant believe you vandalized your own home town, Bart. What would Jebediah Springfield say?	I think hed be cool with it.
This is a Springfield Isotopes cap. When you wear it, youre wearing Springfield. When you eat a fish from our river, youre eating Springfield. When you make lemonade from our trees youre drinking Springfield.	Mom, when you give that lecture, youre boring Springfield.
This town is a part of us all... a part of us all... a part of us all...	Wow, that does work.
When it comes to catchin trout, nothin beats the German light infantry.	Beautiful, arent they?
Thar she grows!	You know Milhouse, Ive been thinking. This town aint so bad. Good friends, lots of lemons, numerous angel sightings -- when you get right down to it, Springfields a pretty cool place to live.
Springfield sucks!	Hey, stop talking bad about my town, man.
Why dont you make me?	I dont make trash, I burn it.
Then I guess youre a garbage man.	Well, I know you are, but what am I?
A garbage man.	Oh, I know you are, but what am I?
A garbage man.	I know you are, but what am I?
A garbage man.	Takes one to know one.
I just put a rock in your crummy town.	Thats a crud rock. It belongs in crud town.
Look at the weak little baby. Youre stupid, you stupid weak baby. Come on, lets get outta here.	Hey! Theyre taking our lemons!
Oh, theyre always eating candy in Shelbyville. They love the sweet taste.	We gotta get that tree back!
Euh. You mean, go into Shelbyville? Euh. Well never make it out alive!	That lemon trees a part of our town, and as kids, the backbone of our economy. Well get it back or choke their rivers with our dead.
Where you going, Bart?	Mom, you wont believe this, but something you said the other day really got through to me.
I choose to take that literally.	Death to Shelbyville!
Radical.	Theyre gettin rich off us!
Euh. The trail has become indistinct. I suggest we split up, to cover more ground.	Good idea. Milhouse, you and me will be Omega Team. Todd, you and Data are Team Strike Force. Nelson, that leaves you and Martin.
What are they saying?	Im not sure.
I thought you said you could read lips.	I assumed I could.
I assumed I could.	Aw. Its no use, Milhouse. If were gonna find that lemon tree, Ive got to go undercover. What I need is a new face.
Wait a minute. If youre from Shelbyville, how come weve never seen you at school?	I dont go to school.
Okay. Whats two plus two?	Five.
Eh, story checks out...	Curse those handsome devils.
You know, I wish there was a Springfield kid here right now. Id fill his mouth with stinkbugs.	No, not in my mouth! Aye--is what the kid would say. To the bluffs!
Yes. And that wig makes him look a lot like one of the Beatles.	Thats right. The stranger who walks amongst you is me, Bart Simpson!
Huh?	You know, Bart Simpson. From Springfield?
Hes from Springfield! Get him!	Ill use these spray cans as jet packs and fly to safety. So long, losers!
Youre dead.	Uh... hey, look! Someones attractive cousin.
Slow down, you sidewalk surfin cube- gleamers!	Uh oh, wet cement!
Uh oh, wet cement!	I could sure use that flying motorcycle now.
You had your chance.	Safe at last!
CAUTION Exit through door seven only. All other rooms contain man-eating tigers.	Roman Numerals. They never even tried to teach us that in school.
Roman Numerals. They never even tried to teach us that in school.	Milhouse! Whats seven in Roman Numerals?
Milhouse! Milhouse! Now what do I do?	Wait! I got it! I got it!
Wait! I got it! I got it!	I dont got it.
I dont got it.	Okay. Think, Bart. Where have you seen Roman Numerals before? I know, Rocky Vee! That was the fifth one. So Rocky Five plus Rocky Two equals Rocky Seven Adrians Revenge!
Oh, its no use. Im never gonna find that tree. This whole raid was as useless as that yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there. Wait a minute! Theres a lemon behind that rock.	The tree!
Well never get the tree back now!	Keep your voices down, boys. We didnt come this far to get found out.
You kids are in big trouble, running away from home like this.	But they stole our lemon tree!
This is the darkest day in the history of Springfield. If anybody wants me, Ill be in the shower.	Theres got to be a way to get that tree back. Hey, look. A hospital! Pull in there.
No one in history has ever done anything this clever.	Ill get the gate.
Woo-hoo!	Eat my shorts, Shelbyville!
Eat my shorts, Shelbyville!	Eat my shorrrrrrrts!
More lemonade, Bart?	Absolutely.
Im happy for the school. It sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities.	Big deal. They didnt approve my idea. They said it was unfeasible.
It is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, Bart. And even if the Three Stooges were alive, I doubt theyd want to hang around with you.	Well, um, yeah. I guess theyd probably want to be with their families or something, huh?
Mr. Burns has been shot!	Burns needs some serious boosta-fazoo. Right, Dad? Dad? Homer?
Hey, the lamps runnin away.	Thats my dog, man.
So long, lamp. Now stop loafing, and help your Grampa unpack.	Wow!
Whug?	No, my dog!
Berserk is right!! May I have some iced tea, please?	Arent we forgetting someone, Sister Suspect?
Yeah, I was just getting to me. Because of Mr. Burns, they canceled my jazz program, and my friend Tito Puente got fired. But I could never shoot someone.	Could so!
Could not!	Could so!
Could not!	Could so!
Could not!	Could so!
I think youre a little young to be investigating an attempted murder. Why dont you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer?	Who wants chocolate ice cream?
The only decent new one is Radiation Dude.	Nah, hes just a cheap imitation of Radioactive Man.
Explain.	The similarities are subtle, but many. For example, Radioactive Man has his famous catchphrase Up and Atom - with atom spelled a-t-o-m in a delicious pun...
Go on.	... while Radiation Dude has a similar, but lamer catchphrase Up and Lets Go.
So, you kids fancy yourselves experts, eh?	Well, between us weve read all 814 issues of Radioactive Man.
I have got to do something about that air conditioner suction.	Whos gonna play Radioactive Man?
Yeah. And who the hell are you talkin to? Marge, do you have other men in this house? Radioactive men?	Im practicing my Fallout Boy dialogue. If I get this role, I could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called Bart.
Watch out, Radioactive Man.	Watch out!
Watch out!	...Radioactive Man!!!
Totally awesome.	Thank you, thank you, thank you. Its all in the delivery. ...Now is the winter of our discontent...
At last the world is safe, eh, Fallout Boy?	Watch out, Radioactive Man!!!!!
Brilliant reading. Again!	Watch out, Radioactive Man!!!!!
Fantastic! One more time.	Watch out, Radioactive Man!!!!!
Oh, Im as tall as I ever was.	Is there anyway I can look taller without actually being taller?
Keep away! etc.	I just missed out on the greatest opportunity of my entire life. George Burns was right -- show business is a hideous bitch goddess.
Cheer up, Bart. Milhouse is still gonna need a true friend. Someone to tell him hes great, someone to rub lotion on him, someone to hurl whiskey bottles at when hes feeling low.	Youre right, Lis. I can suck up to him like the religious people suck up to God.
Better.	Hi, Milhouse. Hey, I want you to know that Im glad at least one of us got the part.
Hi, Milhouse. Hey, I want you to know that Im glad at least one of us got the part.	Milhouse!
Milhouse!	I didnt do it! I wished him well! I wished him weeelll!
Stupid dummy wasnt supposed to explode yet.	Theres the real Milhouse.
Theres the real Milhouse.	Milhouse!
Hi, Bart.	Hey, cool, Milhouse! You get to be crushed by a truck!
Is it, Bart? Is it?	Yes.
Ahhhhh!	Yeah. Ahhh!
No.	Okay, thanks.
Did you know theres a direct correlation between the decline of the Spirograph and the rise in gang activity? Think about it.	I will.
Stay away from me, Bart. I mean it, Im not goin back. Im not cut out to be a star.	But Milhouse, being a star is every patriotic Americans dream.
Not mine. Its a sham, Bart. You get up on that big screen pretending to be a hero, but youre not. The real heroes are out there, toiling day and night on more important things.	Television.
No! Curing heart disease and wiping out world hunger.	But Milhouse! They havent cured anything. Heart disease and world hunger are still rampant. Those do-gooders are all a bunch of pitiful losers. Every last one of them. Want results? You have to go to the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones, and, to a lesser extent, the Van Dammes.
Hi Milhouse. The studio sent me to talk to you, being a former child star myself and the number one box office draw from 1939 through 1940.	Wow, spanning two decades.
Oh, it was no trouble. The hobos at the dump were very helpful. Except one man who seemed to have mental problems.	Gmornin.
Bart, its class photo day. No dracula fangs.	But they told us to wear em.
We bought a wicker basket from Pier One and he was passed out inside.	Hey, how come I get lice and nothing happens to Milhouse?
We love you!	Uh, please dont hug me. It sickens me.
Go with it!	Here you go, Todd. The city edition.
Is your source on this reliable?	I hate this place.
Oh, Bart. I know youre still getting adjusted here. Tell you what. Well do whatever you want to do.	Watch Itchy and Scratchy!
Well, when was the last time Dad gave her that kind of attention?	When she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her.
I thought I could ride this thing out, but everythings just too weird here.	I know. They put honey on their pancakes instead of maple syrup.
Nighty night, my sweet lil foundling-a-dings.	But its only 7 oclock.
You know, Maggie hasnt been a Simpson as long as us. I think shes beginning to forget Mom and Dad.	Remember how Mom used to microwave our underwear on cold days?
Well, guess! Book of Revelations... Fire-breathing lions head... tail made out of snakes... Who else is it gonna be?!	Jesus?
Just sit back, and before you know it, youll be part of the Flanders flock.	Ha ha. Youre gonna be Lisa Flanders.
Oh, relax, Bart. Your sister Maggie isnt scared.	Thats because she cant talk.
Yeah! Gimme all the dirt!	Like I dont have a soul?
Lets see. Dirt... dirt... Well, there wasnt really much dirt.	There was a bunch of old paint cans in their garage, though.
... where fiery demons will punch me in the back...	...where my soul will be chopped into confetti and strewn upon a parade of murderers and single mothers...
Bart did it! That Bart right there!	Milhouse!
I want you to clean every one of these organ pipes that you have befouled with your popular music.	You shank. How could you tell on me?
Well, I didnt want hungry birds pecking my soul forever.	Soul? Come on, Milhouse. Theres no such thing as a soul. Its just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogeyman or Michael Jackson.
I dont hear scrubbing.	Well, if your souls real, where is it?
Its kinda in here. And when you sneeze, thats your soul trying to escape. Saying God bless you crams it back in. And when you die, it squirms out and flies away.	Uh huh. What if you die in a submarine at the bottom of the ocean?
Oh, it can swim. Its even got wheels, in case you die in the desert and it has to drive to the cemetery.	How can someone with glasses that thick be so stupid? Listen. You dont have a soul, I dont have a soul, theres no such thing as a soul.
Fine. If youre so sure about that, why dont you sell your soul to me.	How much you got?
Five bucks.	Deal.
Deal.	There you go one soul.
Pleasure doing business with you.	Any time, chummmmm...p.
Nooooo! Its dripping funny-smelling water all over me!	I wasted five bucks on these.
Whered you get five bucks? I want five bucks.	I sold my soul to Milhouse.
What? How could you do that? Your soul is the most valuable part of you!	You believe in that junk?
Well, whether or not the soul is physically real, Bart, its the symbol of everything fine inside us.	Poor gullible Lisa. Ill keep my crappy sponges, thanks.
Bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever. For five dollars, Milhouse could own you for a zillion years.	Well, if you think he got such a good deal, Ill sell you my conscience for four-fifty.
Aw, honey, youre not a monster.	Ill throw in my sense of decency, too. Its a Bart sales event! Everything about me must go!
Ha! Some ice cream guys gonna see that and itll blow his mind.	Let me try.
Way to breathe, No-Breath.	This is getting weird.
Hmmm... Pablo Neruda said laughter is the language of the soul.	I am familiar with the works of Pablo Neruda.
Yeesss?	Bet youre getting tired of that soul, huh?
Nooooo.	Suppose someone wanted to buy it from you?
...Fifty bucks.	What?!
Hmm. Bart, whats wrong? Theres something a little off about your hug.	Mom, I need to tell you something. I kinda--
Oh, I choose Martin!	Wait! Wait for me!
Bart!	I cant take this anymore. I want my soul and I want it now!
Leave this place. You are in great danger.	Wheres Milhouse?
The one you call Milhouse is gone. He went to his Grammas place while were spraying for potato bugs.	When Milhouse left, did you notice if he was carrying a piece of paper?
Okay, okay. Milhouses Grandmother lives on 257th Street, and Im on Third.	Well, finally, a little luck.
... Curiosity shop... I have powers beyond your imagination...	Hello, Ralph.
Hi Bart. I know you from school.	Yes. A simple proposition, Ralph How would you like to make a dollar?
Uh, I dont know.	All you have to do is sign a paper that says I can have your soul. I need a soul, Ralph. Any soul. Yours.
A caller at this hour? You dial 9-1, then when I say so, dial 1 again.	Milhouse, please.
Bart, I cant play now. Its two A.M.	Milhouse, I gotta have my soul back. Ill do anything you want.
Alf POGS. Remember Alf? Hes back in POG form.	You traded my soul for POGS?! Noooo!!
If you are waiting for the Hi & Lois signing, it has been moved to the Springfield Coliseum.	Please. You have something of mine on a little piece of paper.
Well, since my breakfast burrito is congealing rapidly, I will be blunt. Youre too late. I sold your soul last night. Yes, yes, I found a buyer right away for that item.	Who?
With the change in my piggy bank.	Theres no change in your piggy bank.
Not in any of the ones you know about.	Oh Lis, thank you.
Happy to do it. But you know, Bart, some philosophers believe that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer, like you did last night.	Uh huh.
Not by the hairs of our chinny-chinny-chin.	What a load of crappy-crap-crap.
This is where the wolf blows down the pigs house!	He blows all right. He blows big time.
Whats the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me?	This one spent two hours in the broiler.
Yeah, right, Lisa. A wonderful, MAGICAL animal.	I think Lisas right, dad. Eating meat is ba-a-a-ad.
I think Lisas right, dad. Eating meat is ba-a-a-ad.	Hey, thats my chop!
I never realized before, but some Itchy and Scratchy cartoons send the message that violence against animals is funny.	Say what? Cartoons dont have messages, Lisa. Theyre just a bunch of hilarious stuff, you know, like people getting hurt and stuff. Stuff like that.
Come to Homers BBBQ. The Extra B is for BYOBB.	Whats that extra b for?
But all normal people love meat. If I went to a barbecue and there was no meat, I would say, Yo, Goober! Wheres the meat? Im trying to impress people here, Lisa. You dont win friends with salad.	YOU DONT WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DONT WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...
YOU DONT WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DONT WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...	YOU DONT WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DONT WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DONT WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD / YOU DONT WIN FRIENDS WITH SAL-AD...
One whopper for the copper.	Can I have a burger, dad?
Bart, no!	What?
Its just a little airborne! Its still good! Its still good!	Its gone.
Bart, tell Dad Ill only pass the syrup if it wont be used on any meat product.	You dunkin your sausages in that syrup, homeboy?
Lisa, tell your mother to get off my case.	Uh, Dad, Lisas the one youre not talking to.
What are you waitin for? Wreck the school. You know you wanna.	I agree. Destroy the school.
It worked! Theyre all dead!	Well, except for Chubsy-Ubsy over there.
Okay boy. Catch the Frisbee.	Good catch, boy.
Bart?! Is that you?	Yes.
I dont see what that has to do with Groundskeeper Willie.	Um... We didnt mention Groundskeeper Willie, Mom.
Its no use, Bart. We cant stay up forever.	Youre right. The only thing left to do is to go into my dream and force Willie into a final showdown. You stay awake, and if it looks like Im in trouble, wake me up.
Okay, but promise you wont be grouchy.	Come on, Willie. I know youre out there.
The sandbox!	Hey Lawn-Boy! You missed a spot!
Oh, boy. Dont dream about me no more, kid.	Help! Lisa, help!
Bart, youre in trouble! Wake up!	Wait a minute... If youre here, then youve fallen asleep too!
Good-bye, Bart!	Good-bye Lis. I hope you get reincarnated as someone who can stay awake for fifteen minutes.
Oh yeah? Well its my house, so its my spot.	Nuh-uh, cause we called it.
You are?	Fraid so.
Ugh. Im baking like a meatloaf under this wet wool.	Uh, may I take your coat, Aunt Selma?
No.	No.
Bart, no!	Cool, man!
Im gonna be sucked into the black hole!... Im gonna be sucked into oblivion!... Im gonna be nothing and whats gonna become of me on the other side?! I dont know...	Ill save you, Dad.
Ill save you, Dad.	Oh, I cant get any closer! Youll have to jump!
Bart, what happened?!	Well, we hit a little snag when the universe sorta collapsed on itself... but dad seemed cautiously optimistic.
Yuh-huh, thats the deal. No more exercise program! No more traffic! No more blood drives or charity walks!	Dad, I know we dont do a lot together, but helping you gain 61 pounds is something I want to be a part of.
Hi, everybody!	Hi, Doctor Nick!
Be creative. Instead of making sandwiches with bread, use Pop-Tarts. Instead of chewing gum, chew bacon.	You could brush your teeth with milkshakes!
Oh, its a dream come true, boy! I can, nay, I must, eat everything Ive always wanted. Now cmon! Every second Im out of bed, Im burning precious calories. Now get grabbin!	Eat around the banana, Dad, its just empty vitamins.
Oh, two-twenty-five?! That means I lost weight!	Homer, youre... um... on the towel rack.
Yeah. A crazy guy shot a bunch of people and the subway ran over my hat.	Hey, Lis, come look at this.
Ive got fifteen minutes to gain a pound or I gotta face another day at work.	Bad news, Dad, were out of food. Were even out of the basic elements of food. You ate all the tarragon and you drank all the soy sauce.
Oh, honey, that looks just like a real donut...	Dad? It says Non-Toxic.
Woo hoo hoo hoo! I did it!	Ah, Dad? Towel rack...?
I would if I could.	Not me, sister. When I grow up I wanna be a lardo on workmans comp, just like Dad.
Not me, sister. When I grow up I wanna be a lardo on workmans comp, just like Dad.	I wash myself with a rag on a stick.
Uh... Whats your dads job again?	Hes a Nuclear Safety Technician.
Whats he doin with that broom?	What isnt he doing?
Dont make me close the shade!	Hey, Homer, you promised Mom you wouldnt wear your dress outside.
I think its ironic that Dad saved the day, while a slimmer man would have fallen to his death.	And I think its ironic that for once Dads butt prevented the release of toxic ga--
Mom! Dad! Bart ran into a door frame and bit his tongue!	Whuth va hell ith going on heah?!
Hello.	Where have you been, Granny? Did they freeze you or something?
I dont know what to say. I finally have a mother-in-law. No more living vicariously through my girlfriends!	Hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life, you owe me years of back presents Christmases, birthdays, Easters, Kwaanzas, good report cards...at seventy-five bucks a pop, plus interest and penalties... You owe me twenty-two thousand dollars.
There. Now no one should be able to hear us.	What?
All right, we dont need the dryer.	What?
Just shut up and listen. Theres something fishy about Grandma. Whenever we ask her where shes been all this time, she changes the subject. And just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house.	Yeah, I dont trust her either. When I was going through her purse, look what I found.
Cant reminisce, sleeping.	Spill it, Muddy Mae, or were calling the cops!
Do I know what rhetorical means?!	Quick Gramma, hide!
He framed Krusty. He tried to kill Aunt Selma. He rigged an election.	And he tried to murder me.
I wanna meet the first female Stealth bomber pilot. During the Gulf War she destroyed seventy mosques and her name is Lisa, too!	I wanna see some birds get sucked into the engines! Rare ones!
You still got it, Bob.	Way to guard the parking lot, Top Gun.
Youre ignorant! Thats the Wright Brothers Plane! At Kitty Hawk in 1903, Charles Lindbergh flew it fifteen miles on a thimble full of corn oil. Single-handedly won us the Civil War, it did.	So how do you know so much about American history?
Say, did somebody say box-kites?	No!
Uh... Maggie?	Sideshow Bob!
Stamp your hand for re-entry!	Cool! I want to be around when those guns start going off!
Bart! Bart! What are you doing?! Weve got to get out of here!	Target sighted. Launching air-to-nerd missile!
Well, at least theyre wearing clean underwear.	Free n easy, Lis. Ahh. Theres nothing like an unfurnished basement for pure comfort.
When Bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal. And what makes your voice high?	Tight, binding underwear?
Well, at least Ill have my revenge...	Bob, no!!
Well, if it isnt my arch-nemesis Bart Simpson and his sister Lisa, to whom Im fairly indifferent.	So Krusty double-crossed you. But your basic plan was pure genius. Where do you get your ideas?
Oh, please, lets not embarrass us both with that hoary old stall the villain with flattery scheme.	I shouldve known you were too smart to fall for that.
Ah, for the days when aviation was a gentlemens pursuit. Back before every Joe Sweatsock could wedge himself behind a lunch tray and jet off to Raleigh-Durham.	Are you getting a lot of bugs in your mouth, too?
Jump, boy! I gotcha!	Im comin!
Now you, boy!	You cant escape, Bob! If the tennis rackets dont get you, the pool skimmers will.
Yaaaah!!	Get out of the way, Krusty!
Oh, my little sugar-bug... Im so glad youre safe...	Mo-om! Youre embarrassing me in front of the Army guys.
Well, goodnight, son.	Um, Dad...
Yeah.	What is the mind? Is it just a system of impulses, or is it something tangible?
Relax. What is mind? No matter. What is matter? Never mind.	Thanks, Dad.
Dont touch those yet. Theyre very, very hot.	Aha! No ones around. The perfect crime.
Aha! No ones around. The perfect crime.	Yeow!
Go on, Maggie. Go. Go.	Theres no perfect crime.
Theres no perfect crime.	Ive got a great idea. Lets play Space Patrol.
Ill be Lisui... the devil-may-care rocket pilot.	Maggie can be Maggina, her spunky sidekick.
Bart! Bart! Time for your Sunday night bath, boy!	Gotta hide.
Bart! Where are ya, boy.	Oops.
There you go. Now thats not so bad, is it?	Ahhhh. Welcome to ze exotic world of undersea explorer Bart Simpson.
Ahhhh. Welcome to ze exotic world of undersea explorer Bart Simpson.	Come with Bart as he dive into the briny deep, searching for the wily and elusive wash cloth. Suddenly, without warning, the great Bart get more than he bargain for.
Come with Bart as he dive into the briny deep, searching for the wily and elusive wash cloth. Suddenly, without warning, the great Bart get more than he bargain for.	Help! Help!
Help! Help!	Clean as a whistle, Homer!
Right about now youre probably saying Troy, Ive seen every SimpsonS episode. You cant show me anything new. Youve got some attitude, mister. Besides, youre wrong! Because sometimes episodes run long and certain scenes never get aired. So fire up your VCR, because here for the first time ever are the cut-out classics.	Oh. A soiled wig.
Lawyers... lawyers. Ooh, Lionel Hutz. Cases won in 30 minutes or your pizzas free.	Id sell my soul for a Formula One racing car!
That can be arranged.	Changed my mind. Sorry. Cool!
This movie you rented sucks.	No, let me try the cup and ball.
Bart, youre coming home.	I wanna stay here with Mr. Burns.
Ya want excitement?! Shove this up yer stocking!!	Whoa!!
Hmm. That looks entertaining.	Oh, yeah.
So tell your folks Buy me BoneStorm or go to hell!	Buy me BoneStorm or go to hell!!
Young man, in this house, we use a little word called please...	Its the coolest video game ever!
Im sorry, honey, but those games cost up to and including seventy dollars. And theyre violent and they distract you from your schoolwork.	Those are all good points, but the problem is they dont result in me getting the game.
I know how you feel, Bart. When I was your age, I wanted an electric football game more than anything in the world, and my parents bought it for me, and it was the happiest day of my life. Well, goodnight.	Oh, Ill never get that game.
ALL ABOARD THE SLEEPY TRAIN / TO VISIT MOTHER GOOSE / BARTYS STOP IS SNOOZY LANE / TO REST HIS SWEET CABOOSE.	Mo-om, Im not a little kid anymore. Tuck-in Time is lame.
Well, if loving my kids is lame, then I guess Im just a big lame.	Mom, its lame to be proud of being lame.
Well, life is like a box of chocolates --	Mom! No, Mom!
Seeing as we are unfamiliar with sarcasm, I shall close the register at this point... ... and state that ninety-nine cents is the rental price.	Then may I please rent it, please?
This is great! And all Ive done is enter my name! Thrillhouse!	Say, Cool Dude, can I play, too?
Uh, uh... its only a one player game.	Then how come it says 2nd Player Score?!
Get two. Im not sharing with Caitlin.	That must be the happiest kid in the world.
Its the kind I like!	Are you guys shoplifting?
Just take it! TakeItTakeItTakeItTakeItTakeIt! TAKE IT!	Im outside. I got away with it! Im free!
Sir, would you open your coat please?	Uh... I dont think this is the kind of coat that opens.
Alright, shows over.	E-excuse me?
You think youre pretty smart, dont you?	No.
Dont smart off to me, smart guy.	I-I-I could pay for the game. Ill pay for it.
They werent home. Uh-huh. But I left a message on their answering machine. Thats right.	Um, okay, Ive really really really learned my lesson. Can I please go now?
Well, do you understand?!	Everything except capiche...
Marge, is Lisa at Camp Granada?	Now to put this tape where no one will ever listen to it.
Bart, get your suit on.	What for?
Were getting our Christmas picture taken.	Well, you lucked out, Marge my man, cause Im in a smiling mood today.
Oh, good. So get ready, and before you know it well be at the Try-N-Save.	Try-N-Save?!
Cool! A book of carpet samples!	Come on, new bike!
Whats the matter with your face? Is that a fake nose? Are you wearing chin putty?	I dont have to listen to these wild allegations.
Okay, Sugarplum, its time to meet Mr. Funny-Voice. Helloooo-- --oooh, its just air.	Well, cmon! Hurry up!
Fine. Play the tape. Then everyone can see youve got the wrong boy.	Wait! Mom, I dont want you to see this.
Wait! Mom, I dont want you to see this.	I did it.
Stealing?! How could you?! Havent you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain whats-his-name? We live in a society of laws. Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didnt hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Where was I? Oh yeah, stay out of my booze!	Mom, Im really sorry.
I know you are...	Is there anything I can do?
Goodnight, sweetheart.	Oh great, the tuck-in express in right on time.
Hes not my little baby anymore. Maybe I mother him too much.	Hey, Mom. You didnt wake me up.
Heres your hot chocolate.	You didnt put my marshmallow in.
I think youre old enough to do it yourself now.	Okay. I can handle that.
What? Im more worried about piranhas. Did you see that movie where they send a nuclear submarine to fight the piranhas and one of them swims right down the periscope and bites the guy in the eye and he goes Aaaaaagh! Aaaagh! Aaaagh! and that old lady told em it would happen?!	Yeah, that was pretty good.
Yeah, that was pretty good.	Hey, how come youre not playing BoneStorm?
Whoa! Wow! Man, you never know which way this crazy ball is going to go!	Yeah, right. Youre just trying to trick me because you dont want me playing with your videogame.
Here. Go ahead.	Cmon, dont be a cup and ball hog!
Okay, okay, I wont bug Milhouse... But... Well, Mrs. Van Houten, this is gonna sound kinda dumb, but can I hang out with you while you do mom stuff?	Who are Dan and Sherry Adler?
Just friends of ours.	Oh. And who is Warren Burke?
He used to tune our piano before we got rid of it. He grew up in Mechanicsburg.	Really.
Mmmm-hmmm.	Tell me Im good.
Hey, thats Mom! Shes happy again!	You guys made a snowman family?
Check it out, boy! Its like looking into a living snow mirror!	Why didnt you wait for me?
Its a replacement tire for a wheelbarrow.	Huh.
I knew youd like it.	Everybody thinks Im the black sheep. Well, Ill show them what a black sheep can do.
Are you hiding something? What do you have under your jacket?	Nothing.
Oh, Bart, not again... Give it to me.	I told you I dont have anything.
Oh, Bart. I cant believe you did this.	I wanted to surprise you for Christmas...
I love you so much, my little Bitty Barty.	Mo-ommm...
Now, I know you love video games, and I asked the clerk which is the one every boy wants...	You got me...?
You got me...?	Uh, yeahhh! Thanks, Mom.
Boy, theyre really socking it to that Spiro Agnew guy again! He must work there or something.	Lets do the fold-in.
Okay. What higher power do TV evangelists worship?	Ill say God.
Ooo! Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions! Im great at these. Ask me if something smells funny in here, boy.	Does something smell funny in here?
No, I want roast beef, you clod!	Look at this! Special insert -- Iron-On Mad-ness! BAN THE BATH, DONT TRUST ANYONE OVER TEN, SOCK IT TO ME...
Tonights homework assignment is...	Oh man, is it hot in here! I better take off my sweater.
So we meet again, Mad Magazine...	How do you know its from Mad?
But our momentary lapse of concentration allowed Charlie to get the drop on us. I spent the next three years in a POW camp, forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables, prawns, coconut milk and four kinds of rice. I came close to madness trying to find it here in the States, but they just cant get the spices right...	... Ah, my punishment?
Whoa! Whatever I got ahold of, its big!	Mom, my sling shot doesnt fit in these pockets. And these shorts leave nothing to the imagination. These uniforms suck!
Then what are you dressed like that for?	They made us!
Now, children, while youre having quiet time, Im going to make sure my desk is exactly parallel to the rear wall.	Oh! Theres something I used to do in this situation, but... cant... remember...
Yes, very good.	Wow, look at all the colors, man!
Good ol Evergreen Terrace. The swankiest street in the classiest part of Pressboard Estates.	Well if you love it so much, why are you always littering?
Hey, I never noticed this place!	Dad, its right across the street from us!
Dad, its right across the street from us!	That fancy housell never sell. Nobody who could afford it would want to live in this neighborhood.
Hey! Whats wrong with this neighborhood? Big shot. Too good to buy a house here, Snobby?	Who are you talking to, Homer?
Just gonna relax with my U.S. News and World Whatnot. Oh, good, theyre roasting the new guy!	Helloooo, Mr. Bush!
Hello.	Hi!... Hey, whats this?
Thats me with Charlton Heston. He was --	Whos that, George?
See, you wouldnt know him. Thats Bob Mosbacher. He was Secretary of--	Thats a dumb name. Whos that, George?
Maybe he thinks Bart is a dumb--	How many times were you president, George?
Im making rice. Itll be awhile.	Did your Secret Service goons ever whack anybody, George?
You know, in my day, little boys didnt call their elders by their first names.	Yeah, well, welcome to the twentieth century, George.
Hi, Bart. Mr. Bush is upstairs napping.	You know, your husbands awful grumpy.
What the?! Great Scott! Dont touch that! Thats the alpenhorn Helmut Kohl gave me!	Whered you get those pajamas?
Theyre presidential pajamas. You have to be president. And youre not president.	Yes I am.
No youre not! Bar!!	Hey, wheres your candy?
Good memoirs. Good, not great. Now lets look at that old outboard. Soup that baby up, rattle a few windows down in Kennebunkport next May. Heh heh.	Helloooo, Mr. Bush!
Helloooo, Mr. Bush!	Whatcha doing?
Now, now dont upset the desk there... Careful, dont wanna horse around with--	Hey, cool, what does this do?
He spanked you? You, Bart Simpson?	I begged him to stop, but he said it was for the good of the nation.
This is gonna be sweet. Two hundred bottle rockets and George Bush doing toe touches by an open window.	If you get one up his butt, its a million points.
Hes not lost.	Looks like were experiencing some blow-back from the wig offensive.
Its time to hit him where he lives.	His house?
So I thought to myself, what would God do in this situation?	Locusts. Theyll drive him nuts.
You didnt tell me you destroyed his memoirs! Never!	Yay, Dad!
Heres a little something we learned in the C.I.A.	Get him, boys!!
Yay!! Were getting a new TV!!	Lets go to the Sharper Image. Theyve got a TV shaped like a Fifties diner!
Look at these low, low prices on famous brand name electronics!	Dont be a sap, Dad. These are just crappy knock-offs.
Ive told you, I dont like you using the word hotbed. Please, Lisa, we so rarely get to do things like this. And everybody -- everybody, please -- be on your best behavior. Bart, no grifting.	Aww, raspberries.
Didnt everybody have a wonderful time? I thought it was so opulent -- like the Playboy Mansion, but non-sexual.	That place is weird. A man in the bathroom kept handing me towels, til I paid him to stop.
I knew my kind wasnt welcome here.	Mom, you are lookin fab-u-lous.
Im gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. You know, the one I tried to say on the radio? Heh, heh, whos gonna bleep me this time?	Im gonna pose as an Italian count and get some old lady to leave me all her money.
No, no, no! Not tonight! No vulgarity, no mischief, no politics. Just be good.	Im sorry, Mom. Ill behave.
Hey, did you guys just come from the prom?	Sort of.
What are you going to spend your money on, kids?	Theres a special on tacos down at the The TacoMat. A hundred tacos for a hundred dollars. Im gonna get that.
... and youll find that saving for your future is far more thrilling than any rollercoaster.	Really?! Wow, I shouldve started a long time ago!
I got their new Thrifty Saver Savings account. 2.3% annual interest instead of the normal 2.25. So a year from now Ill have an extra nickel.	I got the account where you get free customized checks. I chose the Hindenberg flip-book series.
I got the account where you get free customized checks. I chose the Hindenberg flip-book series.	Coooool.
A million dollars! Thanks, Bart! I owe you one.	Uh, thats a post-dated check, remember. Dont cash it til the year ten thousand.
Quick -- press against me while the inks still wet!	No need. Im going to get Krustys autograph the easy way.
No need. Im going to get Krustys autograph the easy way.	If he wants these 25 cents, hell have to endorse the check by signing it on the back. Then when my monthly bank statement comes, Ill get the check back complete with autograph. No fuss, no muss.
Ladies and gentlemen Krusty the Clown!... was arrested today for massive tax fraud. Krustys years of tax avoision would never have -- Avoision -- its a crime. Look it up! ... would never have... I dont say evasion, I say avoision. ... would never have come to light if not for a crafty little boy named Bart Simpson.	Krustys my hero! How could I do this to him?
It is a tragedy for all us kids. But, Bart, you cant beat yourself up.	Yeah, therell be enough people to do that for me at recess tomorrow.
Go ahead, kid. Knock yourself out.	Im sorry for all the trouble Ive caused you, Krusty. But, you know, my mom says God never closes a door without opening a window.
No offense, kid, but your moms a dingbat. Theres no silver lining here. I was a big cheese -- a huge cheese! But now look at me! I gotta ride the bus like a schnook! I gotta live in an apartment like an idiot! I gotta wait in line with nobodies to buy groceries from a failure!	It doesnt matter how you live or what you did wrong. As long as youre on TV, people will respect you.
Respect?! What good is respect without the moolah to back it up? Everywhere I go I see teachers in Ferraris, research scientists drinking champagne. I tried to drink a Coke on the bus and they took away my pass! Thats no life for a famous clown!	Well, if itll make you feel any better, Krusty, you can punch me in the face.
Wow.	Aw, thats my Krusty. I got a feeling hell be allll-right.
Bart, youre seeing Krusty everywhere because you want to tell him youre sorry for causing his death. Would it help if I told you youre not responsible for Krustys death?	Yes. Yes it would.
Dont let Krustys death get you down, boy. People die all the time. Just like that. Why, you could wake up dead tomorrow. Well, good night.	Krusty!
Krusty!	Mom! I just saw Krusty!
Yes, dear. In your mind.	No, on the street.
On the street in your mind.	Why wont you believe me?!
...and these pills will help with the queasiness.	Krusty?! Doctor Hibbert, who was that man?
Well I cant. Youll just have to learn to live with your mental problem.	Wait a minute! All those things I saw -- theres a connection! The truck full of nets and buckets, the queasy guy, the lobsters... they all point to one thing. Follow me.
Arrr, Ive got some customers. Call me back, Ishmael. Ahoy there, minnows.	Ahoy! Have you seen this man?
Its hopeless, Bart. Weve searched up and down these docks, from Pier One to that Pier 1 by Pier Seventeen.	Lisa! Look! A signature with stars around it, just like Krustys!
Yes.	How about Krusty the Clown?
Sorry. I dont do impressions.	Well, if youre not Krusty, how come you have the exact same signature as him?
Hey! Youve got a pacemaker scar just like Krusty!	And Krustys superfluous third nipple!
I wont be coming back, kids. Ive got a sweet life here. The sea air is clearing my lungs, the sun is toasting my pale skin a healthy brown, and most important, I learned that I dont need money to be happy. All that high living just distracted me from my true calling in life salvaging sunken barges for scrap iron. Sorry, kids, theres nothing left for me on dry land anymore.	But Krusty, what about all the kids who depend on you to brighten up their afternoons? Are you going to turn your back on them?
Yes.	Cmon, Lis, Krusty doesnt want our attention anymore. Lets go worship somebody who has the guts to be a celebrity.
Meh.	Krustys tired of having phonies around, pretending to be his friends. Im sure hell find plenty of people wholl like him for who he is.
What about that great feeling you get from knowing youre better than regular people?	What about being an illiterate TV clown whos still more respected than all the scientists, doctors and educators in the country put together?
This is going to be great!	I hope they show the time where they traded guns to the Indians for corn, and then the Indians shot them and took the corn.
You think so?	Yeah, Dad! Youre a big fat loudmouth. And you can walk when you have to.
Thats a myth that got mixed up with the truth.	Yes.
Oh, let me help you, George Washington, I still want to help you.	I want to help you, George Washington? Even your dreams are square.
Boy, it sure would be fun to carpool in one of those, huh, kids? Id be a real hot-rod mama, wouldnt I? Huh? Huh?	You missed the race, mama.
Yes! Yes, sir!	Now get cracking on my long division. And dont forget to show your work, Simpson.
I just feel terrible about getting Mr. Smithers fired. That job was all he had. Imagine how youd feel, Marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do.	Quick, Mom! Whip up a cake before Dad fires you!
For knocking Mr. Burns out a third story window.	Makes sense to me.
Bart, Lisa! Its 11 oclock at night. Where do you think youre going?	Downtown.
Hey, the comic book stores still open!	Save our seats!
Hey, my threads, baby!	How come Ive never seen that Itchy and Scratchy before?
Perhaps because you are a pre-pubescent ignoramus. This is a bootleg copy of Itchy and Scratchy Meet Fritz The Cat. Because of its frank depiction of sex and narcotic consumption, it is not for infantile intellects such as yours. Now, Toodle ooo.	Cool. Ill give you ten bucks for that.
Are you the creator of Hi & Lois? Because you are making me laugh. That drawing is worth exactly 750 dollars American.	Its valuable, huh?
Oooh, your powers of deduction are exceptional. I simply cant allow you to waste them here when there are so many crimes going unsolved at this very moment. Go, go! For the good of the city!	Loser.
Which ones Itchy? The car?	The mouse.
Get outta Bumtown, ya no-talent bum!	Show some respect, man! That no talent created Itchy and Scratchy.
He didnt create Itchy. I did.	Huh?
He stole the character from me in 1928. When I complained, his thugs kicked me out of his office and dropped an anvil on me. Luckily, I was carrying an umbrella at the time.	You invented Itchy? The Itchy and Scratchy Itchy?
Sure. In fact, I invented the whole concept of cartoon violence. Before I came along, all cartoon animals did was play the ukulele. I changed all that.	Well, Im not calling you a liar, but... but I cant think of a way to finish that sentence.
So Im a liar, am I?	Itchy The Lucky Mouse In Manhattan Madness.
A chance for more mis...	Look at that fat oaf.
That was a nice film I had once. Last time I try to impress a four year old. Well, see ya, kid.	You cant just go back to the gutter! You created Itchy. You should be a millionaire!
Eh, Roger Myers wouldnt give me a cent in the Twenties, why would he give me anything now?	You asked Roger Myers, Sr. for money. Roger Myers, Jr. is in charge of the studio now. Hes a good man. Every Christmas, he goes down to the pound and rescues one cat and one mouse and gives them to a hungry family.
Studios closed until Tuesday. Animators have AA on Monday.	Hmm. Well, you can stay at my house until then. My parents wont mind, because they wont even know about it.
All right, the coast is clear.	Theres a box you can sleep in.
Thanks.	Just move that cot out of the way.
Okay.	Do you know what Radon is?
No.	Goodnight.
Oh, its just Bart and a mysterious stranger.	Hes not a regular bum, Mom. Hes a genius bum. He created Itchy. And hes the father of cartoon violence.
Hes not a regular bum, Mom. Hes a genius bum. He created Itchy. And hes the father of cartoon violence.	He just needs to stay here till tomorrow. Were going down to Itchy and Scratchy Studios to pick up his check.
All right, gentlemen. Ill take your case. But Im going to have to ask for a $1,000 retainer.	$1,000! But your ad says No Money Down!
Oh dear.	Hey Dad, can I have $1,000?
All right... Wait a minute. For what?	To pay for a lawyer for my bum.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. Theres an easy way to get rid of Chester without the guilt of sending him back to the gutter.	And all it will cost you is $1,000.
Your honor, I move for dismissal.	Ive got it! Dad, give me $750!
Okay.	Keep the trial going. Ill be right back.
Look under the frame, Brad!	Careful... Careful...
Careful... Careful...	Its there!
Now youre catchin on!	What the hell is this?
Its one of those campy 70s throwbacks that appeals to Generation Xers.	We need another Vietnam to thin out their ranks a little...
So its true. Some cartoons do encourage violence.	Ow! We gotta get Itchy and Scratchy back.
And soon.	Ow!
The judge says its okay as long as you pay Mr. Lampwick royalties.	Look, if moneys the only problem, I know a guy who has lots of it.
Okay, catch you on the way back. Oh, hi kids.	Hi, Chester. Listen, would you pay to make more Itchy and Scratchy cartoons?
What for?	Lisa and I want to finance a series of animated cartoons.
I give up. Theres nothing we can do.	Yeah, I agree. You wanna start on trying to get Apu out of jail?
But?	Well... I wasnt the one who solved the problem and neither was Lisa. Theres something unsettling about that.
What a perfect plan. Now Roger Myers hotel is just around the--	What the hell is going on?
And Id like to thank Lester for reuniting me with my estranged wife.	I never even heard about that.
I dont understand it. Were always the ones who solve these problems.	I guess you dont need it now, but we had a plan too.
Well, its not quite a mop, and its not quite a puppet, but, man... So to answer your question, I dont know.	Why did they make that one muppet out of leather?
DR. ZAIUS, DR. ZAIUS!	This play has everything!
I still dont understand why you get to stay home and watch Mom work.	Because Ive always been an advocate of women in the workplace, Lis.
Because Ive always been an advocate of women in the workplace, Lis.	I cant help it if Moms workplace contains our TV.
Well, there you go.	Mom, youre blocking the TV. If you need something to do, you can fill out my form. Here.
Good one.	Well, at least Im not stuck at the cracker factory like Milhouse.
25 years old?! Youre not 25 years old! This I.D. is completely fake!	Yes. You are right, Milhouse. It is a fake. Which makes it a fake I.D.
A fake I.D.?! Cool!!	And its our ticket to the best Spring Break of our lives!
Twenty-five? Whoa! Oh, Im sorry, Mr. S., but you know, I gotta check everybody.	Are you kidding? I take it as a compliment! Three beers, please!
Spring breeeaaak! Yeah! Well, when are we gonna get rowdy?	Maybe when we find something decent to do with this I.D.
Greetings, chums! Were your days at work as profitable as mine? I just had a sinful shopping spree at Wee World.	Well, were having the best Spring Break of our lives, and we dont need you around nerding it up.
But surely I and my $600 could play some small part in your vacation fun.	Oh yeah, right. Like theres any way to get some kicks with a big wad of cash and a license to drive...
Its not fair! Im the best student in school. How come I never heard about this competition?	Maybe because you are, as we say in Latin, a Dorkus Malorkus.
Ow! Bart, Nelson hit me!	He sure did.
A cup holder?!! Bart, weve gotta stop and get a cup! Uh... Bart?	Cruise control, my good man. Everybody all set back here? Nelson, good to see you! Martin, always a pleasure...
Grammar Rodeo?! Were goin to a Grammar Rodeo?!	Were not going to a Grammar Rodeo! That was just an alibi, Milton!!
Martin.	Martin.
Wait! How about a fair? Not just a county fair. Not just a Europe fair. But a WORLDS Fair! The Worlds Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee!	Keep reading...
The Hungarians have built a giant, motorized Rubiks Cube! And the fairs symbol is the Sunsphere, which sits atop a 266 foot tall steel shaft!	Whats inside?
Coooool!	So its a choice between Disneyworld and Knoxville.
Knoxville! Knoxville! Knoxville!	I concur.
Bart, can we pick up that hitchhiker?	I dont see why not.
Bart, can we stop for ice cream?	Yes.
What is this place?	Branson, Missouri. My dad says its like Vegas if it were run by Ned Flanders.
Andy Williams?!	Uh, we dont need to stop here.
Hurry up! Weve only got four days to spend at the... Wod Fir?	Uh, excuse me... Is this the Worlds Fair Visitors Center?
But theres another Worlds Fair coming soon, right? Before Friday?	What about the Sunsphere?
I guess fate was against us. Its really nobodys fault. Right? Uh, right?	Well, weve still got a car and a wad of cash.
You are hearing me talk.	Weve got no car!
Fellows, I think perhaps the time has come to call our parents.	No!! Theyd kill us! Look, we got here on our own, so we can survive here on our own. All we need is money, food, and a way to get home. Follow me.
No!! Theyd kill us! Look, we got here on our own, so we can survive here on our own. All we need is money, food, and a way to get home. Follow me.	Everybody remember were parked under the Sunsphere.
Five hundred. Four hundred. Three hundred. Two hundred. One hundred. Zero...	Come on! This train goes right through Springfield!
So hows the National Grammar Rodeo, Bart?	Lisa, I really need your help, so Im gonna let you in on a secret. Theres no such thing.
I knew it! I knew it because why would they have our National Grammar Rodeo in another nation?! Oh, Bart, youre going to be in sooo much trouble when--	Im in trouble already. Heres what happened...So youve got to think of a way I can come home for free.
Im in trouble already. Heres what happened...So youve got to think of a way I can come home for free.	Milhouse, dyou ever think about the people in those cars?
Can we call our parents yet, Bart?	Lisa? This isnt working. Ive got to courier something to Springfield. And its gotta be big enough to fit Milhouse, Martin, and Nelson inside.
Simpson, howd you like to escort 500 Big Macs to Marlon Brandos island?	Oh, I cant take much more of this. Im counting on you, Lis.
Uh, Bart... Bart, we really could use another air hole.	Ssshh! Theyll know youre in there!
I try not to. It makes it harder to spit on em.	Sometimes I wonder about all the people in this town. Do you think anything interesting ever happens to them? I mean, there must be thousands of great stories out there.
Sometimes I wonder about all the people in this town. Do you think anything interesting ever happens to them? I mean, there must be thousands of great stories out there.	What do you think, Milhouse? Milhouse?
Hunh? Oh, sorry, I saw a convertible. You were saying?	Forget it. Cmon, its 11 oclock. I need some sugar.
Yep, everybody in towns got their story to tell.	Theres just not enough time to hear em all...
Youre living in a fools paradise, Van Houten. If you fell down in the shower, that thingd be your tomb!	Grampa, hush.
Grampa, hush.	Here, why dont you spit some more.
Bart, perhaps your grandfather would like to come up front now and give someone else a chance to interrupt.	Oh, please, no.
You already put him in a home.	Maybe its time to put him in one where he cant get out.
Its plenty moist! Listen, Monty Burns is tryin to kill me and its all because of um... I cant tell you why.	Well, Im sure youll make up something. Maybe you just need more of my classmates around.
Barts room.	Dumpster.
Sorry to crowd ya, boy, but Ill let you in on a secret. Burns is after me cause he wants the Hellfish Bonanza.	Look, if youre going to stay in my room, could you at least stop making up gibberish?
Gibberish, eh? Then whats this?	Wrinkly gibberish?
Dead -- tired, but Im quite refreshed now, thank you.	Mmm-hmm. You bossed around the richest, most powerful guy in town. How come you were a sergeant and he was only a private?
Boom! Boom, it went! Boom! Just like that! They took a photo of my keister for Stars & Stripes. At least they told me it was for Stars & Stripes.	Well, if you saved Burns life, why does he want to kill you?
Ox was the first to go -- he got a hernia carrying the crate out of the castle. Five more men died in the Veterans Day float disaster of 79. Now with Asa gone, its down to me and Burns.	Great story, Grampa. Coulda used a vampire, though. Night.
Ive tried to meet you halfway on this, Simpson, but you had to be Little Johnny Live-a-lot. Now give me your key to the Hellfish Bonanza.	Oh wow! There really is a treasure! Whatever you do, dont give him the key, Grampa!
Heres the key.	Figures... Hey, Mr. Burns!
Figures... Hey, Mr. Burns!	Can I go with you to get the treasure? I wont eat much and I dont know the difference between right and wrong.
I guess Burns is finally gonna be rich.	Not without the keys, he isnt.
Hey, you got the keys!	Now we can get the treasure!
Oh, whats the use? Burns would still find some way to take it from me.	I cant believe you, Grampa. The sergeant in that story you told would never be scared of a dork like Burns! You gotta get that treasure! You gotta do it for Ox and Asa and Griff and Burnsie... Well, not so much Burnsie.
You really think I can do it?	Uh, yes. But we gotta act fast!
Where are you two going at this hour?	On a treasure hunt.
Now remember the plan, boy. If you run out of air, tug on the rope--	--sixty-four times. No more, no less. Got it.
No, no. Sixty-three times if youre out of air. Sixty-four is if you found the treasure.	Gotcha. Hey, Grampa, do you think I couldve been a Flying Hellfish?
Youre a gutsy daredevil with a give-em-hell attitude and a fourth-grade education. You coulda made sergeant.	Wo-o-o-ow!
Youre one heckuva grandson, boy! Now, lets break er open and have a look-see.	Huh. The light mustve burned out.
Consarn it!	You coward! Youre an embarrassment to the name Hellfish!
Its been an honor to serve you, sir.	Consarn it, hes getting away!
Now, Burnsie, theres one thing we dont stand for in the Hellfish, and thats trying to kill your commanding officer. So consider this your dishonorable discharge. Youre outta my unit. Youre outta the tontine. And that means the paintings are mine. Private, you are dismissed.	Youre rich, Grampa! You did it! And Burns can never take that away from you!
I guess he deserves it more than I do... Well, at least I got to show you I wasnt always a pathetic old kook.	You never were, Grampa.
Aw, Id hug ya, but I know youd just get embarrassed.	I wont get embarrassed. I dont care who knows I love my Grampa.
Now to drop gracefully through the windshield.	Ive got ya, dad!
Open your eyes, Lisa. Our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like Bart have lost the will to learn.	Theres no denying it, Sis.
200,000 precisely-ordered punch cards comprising the worlds very first tic-tac-toe program. Only the top human players could beat it.	Hey, whats this one for?
I do appreciate your concern, really, but it is hopeless. The latest poll shows a whooping 85% support for Proposition 24.	Hey, Apu, why dont just marry some American broad, then dump her after you get your citizenship?
Thats it!	Didja hear that, Mom? Shes as dumb as me!
Da-ad! Youre not pointing anywhere near Springfield. Its over here, Apu.	Hey, whatcha doin -- studyin?
So how bout those rainbow suspenders, huh?	Dad?
Pretty cool way to keep your pants up, eh?	Dad?
And when I listen to a really good song, I start nodding my head, like Im saying yes! to every beat. Yes, yes, yes this rocks! And then sometimes I switch it up like No, no, no, dont stop a-rockin...	Dad, please. Youre embarrassing us.
Now -- Grand Funk Railroad paved the way for Jefferson Airplane, which cleared the way for Jefferson Starship. The stage was now set for the Alan Parsons Project, which I believe was some sort of Hovercraft...	Dad! No one cares about any of your stupid dinosaur bands! You have the worst, lamest taste in music ever!
Im just trying to party with you guys.	Homer, first of all its par-tay. And second, we wouldnt par-tay with you if you were the last dad on earth.
Bart, these look real.	Check the authenticator spot.
Oh, I get it.	Dad, you cannot wear that! Thats a rastafarian hat!
Well, excuuuuuuse me!	You know what, Dad? Maybe well go exploring on our own for a while.
It may be bleak, but this music is really getting to the crowd.	Aw, making teenagers depressed is like shootin fish in a barrel.
People know your name, but you dont know theirs. Its great.	Dad, do you wear boxers or briefs?
Nope.	What religion are you?
Whats with all the questions?	Just some report I gotta do for school. Hey, you want some pie?
This is so exciting. Last time I got to go backstage was when Bart ripped his pants at the Christmas play.	Mo-om!
Shh, Mom. Dad needs our support.	Youre the coolest dad alive!
Wait, Marge. Maybe if youre truly cool, you dont need to be told youre cool.	Well, sure you do.
Hey, Bart, summers almost here. Which kind of sprinkler do you like the one that goes like this? Or the one that goes like this?! Oh, and theres this one!	Its the last day of school, Milhouse. Try to show some dignity.
This is Becky, shes in the second grade.	Hi, Becky. Thanks for comin out.
See ya! He writes the way people talk!	Your daughter is named Seymour?
A microscope at the beach -- ugh, what was I thinking?	Mom, Im gonna tighten Milhouses straps. Hes fidgeting again.
Bye-bye, job.	Bye-bye toothbrush.
Its called Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport. Its known as Americas scrod-basket.	I thought Springfield was Americas scrod-basket.
Hey, Bart, Lisas skateboarding with some cool kids! And she looks like Blossom!	Lisa? With people? If theyre impressed by her, Im gonna Bart their world. Okay, Milhouse, you know the drill.
Right. You go over and wow them, I hide in the shrubs.	Hot stuff comin through!
Howd it go? Are we down with them?	No. They must have seen you.
Gee, I dont know what youve got planned for tonight, Homer, but count me out. Didnt you buy any meat?	Check this out Miss Perfect Attendance.
This babys sure to kill something. Okay, now everybody -- stand back while I celebrate freedom. Bart, give me your matches.	Fresh out.
I dont think you should. Let Lisa be alone with her new friends.	Theyre my friends, rightfully. She only got them by copying me!
Oh, you havent said that in four years. Let Lisa have it.	Its the principle. Shes gotta learn!
I just know were gonna be friends forever.	So Lisa has a friend. Well see about that.
My yearbook! No!	Hey, you guys! You wanna see how cool Lisa Simpson really is?
Hey, you guys! You wanna see how cool Lisa Simpson really is?	Grammar Rodeo -- Head Buccaroo.
Grammar Rodeo -- Head Buccaroo.	The French Table -- ooh la la.
Kids! Stop that! Dont make me get the carney!	Hey, Lisa, make friends with this!
The polite thing to do wouldve been to clean the shells first. Shoo, shoo!	I guess I should give this back to you.
I guess I should give this back to you.	I showed it to your friends again before we left.
Bart!	Look inside.
Did you hear that, Bart?	Maybe it was just the cat.
Hurry up! Mom and Dadll be home soon!	The unsold copies of Dads autobiography.
Bart, do you think its safe?	I dont care. I cant breathe in here.
Yes, Doctor, its what weve always feared its loose. Hugo is loose. See you soon.	Who or what is Hugo?
It saved our marriage!	You expect me to believe all this? If any of it was true, wouldnt I have a big, hideous scar...
Right. Bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game.	Youre here, arent you?
Yes, Bart. I never left you.	W-w-what do you want from me?
Am I? Well, perhaps were all a little crazy. I know I am. I went mad after they tore us apart. But Ill be sane once I sew us back together.	But youll kill both of us!
This tooth will be perfect for my science project.	Hey, Dad.
Science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and Chinese food. But I can still ruin soft drinks for everyone.	Hey, Lis. Check out my science project.
Ow! Whats that supposed to prove?	That nerds conduct electricity.
Wow, its almost like seeing into the future!	Hey, what is this goo? Are you trying to grow a friend?
Hey, what is this goo? Are you trying to grow a friend?	Hey, you built a model city. Is that the school?
Hey, you built a model city. Is that the school?	Oops, my fingers slipped. Oops, my fingers slipped. Oops, my fingers slipped.
Well, you practically destroyed their whole world!	You cant protect them every second. Sooner or later youll let your guard down, and then -- flush! Its toilet time for tiny town.
Marge, Marge! There I was, I had just caught the largest fish youd ever seen, when I was abducted by a flying saucer!	Sure you were, rummy.
Yeah. Did you notice how the people werent shoving or knocking each other down? Ive never been to a place like that before.	Me neither!
Oh, wow, windows. I dont think I can afford this place.	No it hasnt, Dad. Thats why were leaving.
Well never sell this rotten dump.	Ah, little help here?
Bart, as the newest addition to our menagerie, you have the honors.	Um... Uh...
Well, lets start by reading the sentence...	Two, wintim amd Jawwy wirt...
So, you never learned cursive?	Um, well, I know hell and damn and bi--
Cursive handwriting. Script. Do you know the multiplication tables? Long division?	I know of them.
Okay. Now everyone take out your safety pencil and a circle of paper. This week I hope we can finish our work on the letter A.	Let me get this straight. Were behind the rest of our class, and were going to catch up to them by going slower than they are?
Stop it! Stop it! Warren! Melvin! Gary! Dot! Gordy!	Look, lady, Im sposed to be in the fourth grade.
I knew youd do well, Homer.	Sports collectibles! Wow, a baseball made out of Secretariat!
Tom Landrys hat! And its autographed! To Bermans Dry Cleaning, Best Wishes, Tom Landry.	Why dont you buy it?
Well, the Simpson men are doing fine, right, Bart? You havent even gotten in trouble at school.	I cant get in trouble at school. They put me in the remedial class! Im surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round!
I cant get in trouble at school. They put me in the remedial class! Im surrounded by arsonists and kids with mittens pinned to their jackets all year round!	Hey Dad...
Hey Dad...	We want to go back to Springfield.
...but it looks like Father Time took care of that for us, right? Am I right, folks?	Oh, this sucks!
Gee, I hate to let you down, Casanova, but uh, no receipt, no return.	Ill give you four bucks for it!
Wow! I bet if God wore pants, hed have a belt like that!	This isnt a belt, its a Tactical Pants-Retaining System. Check it out compass, matches, whistle, saw, panic button, squirrel snare, radon-slash-lie detector, sphygmomanometer... and its even got turn signals!
Hey, Simpson, wanna trade belts?	Well, not really... cause yours is just a piece of extension cord...
No running!	Time for a little evasive action...
Help. Help. Help.	I was hoping it wouldnt come to this, but you guys asked for it...
I was hoping it wouldnt come to this, but you guys asked for it...	Cant you read? Call the police!
Hey, what happened to your belt?	Some bullies beat me up and took it.
Son, theres only one thing punks like that understand squealing. Youve got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. Coming to me was a good start.	But then theyll just beat me up even worse.
Now, no matter how much he hits you, you dont do nothin, okay? You dont wanna get drawn into a boxing match here.	Way to go, Dad! Take those punches!
Get yer T-shirts! Tell em where youve been by wearing a T-shirt!	Youll be okay, Dad. Just make sure he hits you an even number of times so you dont end up with amnesia.
What are you talking about?	Isnt Dad the one in the black trunks?
No.	Uh-oh.
Oh, thats all right. Well just wait until everyone else leaves.	I got your tooth, Dad!
Cant they get a pole for that sign?	Thats a hitchhiker, Homer.
Hey, Im looking for this guy. Anybody know who he is?	Yeah, sure, we know him. Thats Mr. Burns.
Hes not a drifter, Mom. Thats Mr. Burnss son, Larry.	Hes great at pointing out everyones foibles!
Hey, how ya doin? Whoo, look at your hair. What happened? -- You saw yourself in the mirror?	Hes kidding, Mom. But seriously, Id love to have hair like yours -- I just cant get the zoning permits.
Hey, kids, how bout a hand for your Mom? Shes all right!	More food.
Hey, I think I got a Pai Gow!	I hate Pai Gow. Cant we just play Quang Jong?
Ohhh! Give yourself up, Homie!	No, Dad! Shoot your way out!
And if anything happens, just use your best judgm... Just do what I would do.	Woo hoo!
A whole week of just father and son! See you at dinner.	What time?
You know, I dont know.	Shall we say ten?
Live! From the Grand Ballroom of the Hapsburg Imperial Palace, its the World Series of Bumper Cars!	Dad, do I have to brush my teeth?
Geez, look at this place. We gotta do something.	Huh -- garbage angels?
Do I have to sit up?	No.
Thats the house?!	Stand aside, wussies.
Go away. No children.	Enough talk.
Enough talk.	S-U-C-C-E-E-S / Thats the way you spell succes--
Preciate the suggestion, lady, but he hates that. And I gotta live with him.	Youre the man, Homer.
Oh, I dont know how to punish you! What does Marge usually do?	She makes me taste beer.
Come on in, Bart.	Oh, I cant believe I gotta spend all my free time dustin doilies in a smelly, run-down dump for a creepy old witch...
Oh, I cant believe I gotta spend all my free time dustin doilies in a smelly, run-down dump for a creepy old witch...	Lady, I gotta tell ya -- I have been grossly misinformed about witches.
I prefer not to be called man. My name is Belle, and this is the Maison Derriere. That means the, uh, back house.	Are you having a party or something?
Normally, we dont allow children in here, but your father was so insistent...	Hes tough but fair. Ill start sorting these bras.
Thats a bit advanced for you. But I know a stopped-up sink that needs some attention.	Just glad to be on the team!
When you work the door, the main things are to greet the visitors and toss out the troublemakers.	Oh, the ol greet n toss. No problemo.
What the ?! Does your father know youre working here?	It was his idea.
Oh, that was our emcee, Mel Zetz. He got out of bed too fast and broke his hip.	So whos gonna warm up the crowd tonight?
Well, whoever fits Mels tuxedo.	Eep.
The jokes are in the breast pocket. If you get in trouble, theres a switch that makes the bow-tie spin.	Heh. Nudist colonies are everywhere these days. Id love to go, but I... I cant get the wrinkles out of my birthday suit!
Oh, yeah, drugs. Ya gotta have drugs.	Hey, he didnt pay the cover!
Oh, I hope I didnt miss the floor show...	Nope.
Is Roxanne back?	Yup.
Did she, uh, get my flowers?	She did.
I... Hello, Bart.	Hello, Principal Skinner.
Oh, shut up! Youre wasting valuable smashing time!	Dad, we cant let this happen to Belle! Do something!
WITHOUT IT WED HAVE HAD NO FUN SINCE MARCH OF NINETEEN SIXTY-ONE!	TO SHUT THEM DOWN NOW WOULD BE TWISTED,
Im so sorry. How can I ever make this up to you?	Oh, theres a way, Mom...
Take it off!	All right, Dad, youve been warned. Lets go.
Hey...	Cmon...
Yoink.	If you really wanted us to be neater, youd serve us out of one long bowl.
Youre talking about a trough! Were not going to eat from a trough! And another thing -- its only 515. Why are you in your underwear?	Hey, this aint the Ritz.
I know its not! Im going into the dining room to have a conversation. Anyone who wants to join me is welcome.	Mom, Reverend Lovejoy doesnt have a coat. Should I let him in?
Its just not a dinner party without a melon baller. And well need a citrus zester... a ravioli crimper... Ooh, an oyster mallet! Made in U.S.A.? Eh, no thank you!	Hey Lis -- check this out. Non-stick coating.
Hey Lis -- check this out. Non-stick coating.	Oooh, a punch bowl like that just screams good taste. Wouldnt it be perfect for the dinner party?
Thats a door?	Hello, Im Dr. Hibbert. Im afraid Im going to have to amputate your butt.
Chase, its only been three hours.	Whos Chase?
Oh, thats Moms new boyfriend.	Hey, I know you from American Gladiators. Youre Pyro!
Only on weekends. During the week, Im just your average work-a-day stunt man.	Really?
Go ahead, break a chair on me.	Wow, thanks!
I guess it is a little funny... Nonetheless, I will find the culprit. Well start with, oh, I dont know... Bart Simpson!	Um, I dont think you want to look in there, sir.
I believe you! I dont care!	Hey, Lis, Mom said you had the toenail clippers and-- Whoa, Lisa! Look out! Nelsons in our house!
Its okay, I invited him over. Nelsons my new... friend.	Are you nuts? Ill probably never say this to you again, but you can do better.
Please dont ruin this for me, Bart. I think hes starting to like me!	Milhouse likes you.
Oh, please. Milhouse likes Vaseline on toast.	Hmmm.
One at a time.	Spin the middle side topwise. Topwise.
Uh, Ned, you ever tried lugging a toilet up a flight of stairs?	Lisa and I built your room.
But I dont like this clown!	Uh, I wouldnt take it down if I were you. Its a load-bearing poster.
Well, my family and I cant live in good intentions, Marge! Oh, your family is out of control, but we cant blame you, because you have goooood intentions.	Hey, back off, man.
Not me.	Not me. Im more of a mail-tamperer.
Im gonna go get some vegetarian chili before they get desperate and add meat.	Im gonna go claim some valuables at the Lost and Found.
I saw it, Bart.	Youre just mad cause theres no clock in your hat.
What hat?	Aw, this babys wasted on an idiot like you. Wheres Homer?
Hi, kids.	Ill finish this later. Hi, Dad.
Out back.	So anyway, I says to Mabel, I says...
All right! Its time for ABCs TGIF lineup!	Lis, when you get a little older youll learn that Fridays just another day between NBCs Must-See Thursday and CBSs Saturday Night Crap-o-rama.
Its just that the people who claim theyve seen aliens are always pathetic low-lifes with boring jobs! Oh, and you, Dad. Heh heh...	I am the thing from Uranus!
Oh. Its Bart. I cant believe it. Im being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!	Its your birthday?
Santas Little Helper, its your birthday? Weve got to get you a present! Yes we do! Yes we do!	We love you boy!
Oh, I suppose youre going to mock me, too.	Well, actually, Dad... I believe you.
You do?	Yes, I do. You seem so damn sure.
Thank you, son. And do you think you could stop the casual swearing?	Hell, yes.
Thats my boy. Well, if you believe in me, then Im not going to give up. Ill prove Im right. This Friday were going back to the woods, and were going to find that alien!	What if we dont?
Well fake it and sell it to the Fox network.	Theyll buy anything!
Coors.	Yo, Dad, can I have a sip of your beer?
No! No! No-o-o-o-o!	You know, Dad, it doesnt matter that we didnt see the alien. Ive really had a great time out here.
Its gone. And we still dont have any proof.	Oh yes we do! I got it all on tape.
Very unprofessional, Phil.	Well, Lis, what do you think about the alien now?
Wherever there is mystery and the unexplained, cosmic forces shall draw me near.	Uh-huh.
The most rewarding part was when he gave me my money.	But whats with the glowing?
Danger! Danger! Dont forget to pick up pamphlets!	Ill handle this.
I had that dream again!	Wooo! Were number one! Were number one!
Wooo! Were number one! Were number one!	Hey, whats going on?! Wait, wait! Hey, let go of me!...
So Burns is going to make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork. Which means well have to cancel our plans to hang around here.	Teamwork is overrated.
Huh?	Think about it. I mean, what team was Babe Ruth on? Who knows?
Thank you. Now pair off as I draw your names. Lenny and... Carl.	Sharing is a bunch of bull too. And helping others. And whats all this crap Ive been hearing about tolerance?
You pressed you, referring to me. That is incorrect. The correct answer is you.	Mom, can Lisa and I play outside, away from the bear?
Why, thank you, Simpson. I have been watching my figure.	Lis, Lis, come here! I found two snowflakes that are exactly alike!
Well help you.	I have a watch with a minute hand.
All right. You can come. What time is it?	1280. No, wait. Wait. Wh-- what comes after twelve?
One.	No, after twelve.
There isnt any food in any of these trees. Please Bart, weve got to hurry. I cant be the last one to reach the cabin.	Hey, Im not gonna get fired. Is there any gold in this mountain?
Okay, search party. Before we set out, lets take a moment to humor the children. Kids, your fathers gonna be just fine. Okay, everybody, put on your corpse handling gloves. Weve got two frozen bodies buried somewhere in this mountain.	Did you hear that, Lis? Dads gonna be just fine.
Youre not gonna like our NYPD Shoe sketch. Its pretty much the same thing.	Ma, could you get me some milk?
Cant you get it yourself?	Oh, thats okay. Ill just go without liquid.
Oh, all right, all right, Ill get your milk!	Thank you.
Well, its blue... six feet long...	Ewwwwww!
Phone call, Mrs. Simpson. Lines one and two.	Ma, I need a glass of milk.
Well... I was thinking we could hire a nanny to help me out.	A nanny?!
Well find a way. Mom has made so many sacrifices for us -- its time we gave up something for her. Ill stop buying Malibu Stacey clothing.	And Ill take up smoking and give that up.
IF YOU WISH TO BE OUR SITTER / PLEASE BE SWEET AND NEVER BITTER / HELP US WITH MATH AND BOOK REPORTS /	MIGHT I ADD, EAT MY SHORTS.
Bart!	Just cuttin through the treacle.
IF MAGGIES FUSSY, DONT AVOID HER.	LET ME GET AWAY WITH MOIDER.
Oh yeah. So, you worked for Carl, eh?	I have a question.
I have a question.	Pop quiz, hotshot. Im sposed to be doing my homework, but you find me upstairs reading a Playdude. What do you do? What do you do?
All right children, lets clean up this room.	Oh, man.
IF NOBODY SEES IT, THEN NOBODY GETS MAD.	ITS THE AMERICAN WAY!
Oh Shary Bobbins, this is ever so much fun!	With you, every day is Guy Fawkes Day!
But were not sleepy.	Sing us a song, Shary Bobbins.
AND SO LET US LEAVE ON THIS HEARTWARMING SCENE --	CAN I BE A BOOZEHOUND?
Ooh, I cant get enough of this blood pudding.	The secret ingredient is blood.
BUT THE BEER WILL TASTE MORE SWEET / IF YOU GET UP OFF YOUR SEAT --	Lady, the man asked for a beer, not a song.
Bart Simpson, this room is a frightful mess.	Ill get right on it.
Bart, dont you remember? Cleaning up can be a game.	Ive got a better game. Its called Whippin Cupcakes.
Weve crushed her gentle spirit.	You people should be ashamed of yourselves.
Nope.	Nope.
IM GETTING USED TO NEVER GETTING NOTICED.	IM STUCK HERE TILL I CAN STEAL A CAR.
Sure, we love it! But how can we watch TV when its so beautiful out?	Yeah, Mom. I mean, we love you and Dad too, but God knows we dont need to see you every day.
An occasional hug is all I ask.	Mo-om, you can hug me when Im asleep.
I need to purchase a brassiere. You kids wait over here in the credit department.	Cant we just wander around and meet you back here later?
I do not!	Havent you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?
I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.	Well, here. Say something.
Hey, this is Homer Simpson sayin-- I dont sound like that, do I? Oh, I dont like having such a hilarious voice.	That hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom.
Is this seat taken, little girl?	Im not a girl! Are you blind?
So it was pretty okay, huh?	Mom, can we go to bed without dinner?
No, its not your fault, dad. You did fine. Its just that Poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. You cant be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords.	Dont have a cow, Lis.
Last nights Itchy and Scratchy was, without a doubt, the worst episode ever. Rest assured that I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.	Hey, I know it wasnt great, but what right do you have to complain?
As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me.	What? Theyve given you thousands of
What? Theyve given you thousands of	hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, if anything, you owe them.
Then they said they were gonna kill Poochie off!	Really?! Oh, how terrible!
So?	Wow -- Poochie came from another planet?
Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live and learn.	Its back to the basics. Classic Itchy and Scratchy!
We should thank our lucky stars theyre still putting out a program of this caliber after so many years.	What else is on?
Come on, cantaloupe!	Aannd round and round she -- uh-oh.
Missy, you just talked yourself right out of a sale.	Hey, Lis, check it out! Pogo Stilts! These were banned in all 50 states!
Ech! Think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside...	Aw, boo hoo. Thats what they get paid for.
Ow! Why you little...	Dad! Dad! Company! Company!
Mom, John likes Itchy and Scratchy as much as we do -- maybe more!	Yeah, and he collects toy robots!
No, no! Im not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!	Oh, Dad, you are the living end.
Oh, Dad, you are the living end.	Hey, whered that cool creepy Santa come from?
Oh, and Im not.	Hey, Dad, look what I got! Zzzapp!! Zzzapp! Zzzapp! Zzzapp!
Bart! Whered you get that shirt?	Iunno. Came outta the closet.
Dont worry, boy. Were gonna set you straight. By tomorrow morning, youll be a regular Burt Reynolds.	What are you talking about, Homer? Where are we going?
Well its been two hours. How do you feel?	Iunno. I kinda want a cigarette.
Thats a good start. Lets get you a pack. Whats your brand?	Anything slim!
Roscoe here runs this mill. Hes gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real All-American Joes doin what they do best.	Why the hell would I want to see that?
Today youre gonna be a man, Bart!	You guys gonna teach me to drive?
Yever been huntin before there, Barty?	Nope. Something about a bunch of guys alone together in the woods... seems kinda gay.
Hey, boy, wake up! Your old man found some deer!	Huh? You did? Wait, man, those are reindeer.
Where are the dice?	What? Im not gonna shoot a reindeer in a pen.
Cmon, Bart. Be a sport and kill Blitzen, okay?	Da-ad --
Attaway, son! You made your old man proud!	I didnt do anything.
Me too, son.	No, dont! You have to protect yourself!
UNNGHH!!	Dad, are you hurt?
Bart, look! Its Santa Claus!	Whoa, its Santa, all right! And he is kickin ass!
Ive been tenderized.	Howd you know that thing would work?
Yknow, Bart, maybe its just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me.	Huh?
He thinks youre gay.	He thinks Im gay?
Just remember, Bart, convicts arent cool. Theyre bad people.	Yeah, maybe so. But they get the job done.
Or so youd think, except hes done it so many times before.	Thanks for trying, guys, but Sideshow Bob wants me dead, and Sideshow Bob is an unstoppable killing machine.
How can you even think of releasing Sideshow Bob?	Hes just faking it to get out of jail! Hes a maniac!
Probably!	Dont you see what youve done? Sideshow Bob hasnt reformed! Hes pure evil! Oh, if only you knew what he was thinking...
Bart, no!	Its him or me, O Lord!
Come on, Bob. This is your chance to show the people of Springfield you can hold down an honest job.	Hes planning something evil, I know it. It must have something to do with the towns water supply.
Maybe hes gonna pee in the river.	Um... Nah, thats not his style.
Oh, you!	Mrs. Krabappel, nooo! Thats Sideshow Bob!
That was Edna Krabappel. You only get one chance with Edna Krabappel. I hope youre happy.	I wont be happy until I find out what youre up to. Wherever you go and whatever you do, Ill be there watching and waiting.
Hey, you said we were going to Dairy Queen.	I lied. Now help me rummage through Bobs trash for clues. Then I promise well go to the water slide.
I know its hard to accept, Bart, but face it Sideshow Bob has changed.	No, he hasnt. Hes more the same than ever. And I know where the evidence is. Theres only one place it could possibly be.
Bobs trailer at the construction site?	Thats even better. Lets go there.
What were you thinking?	The Haunted Mine.
If I didnt know better, Id swear Bob was building a dam.	Oh, yeah? Then explain this!
Bart, there must be millions of dollars there!	What is Sideshow Bob doing with --
Who left the lights on?!! Whos in here? Cletus? Cousin Merl? Big Hungry Joe?	I hink he nay have spotted us.
Will you children stop tormenting me? Ive done nothing wrong.	Give it up, Bob. We found the money.
You cut back on building materials and kept all the money for yourself! Thats what happened.	Get im, Lis!
Bart, for once Im not trying to kill you. I know its an awkward situation, and I dont like it any more than you do. But youve got to trust me.	Ah, what the hell.
Plunger? Check. Hardhat? Check. Fifteen million dollars and a gun? Check-mate. Goodbye, Bob.	Nooo!
Nooo!	Guess who!
At last, Im going to do what Bob never could -- kill Bart Simpson!	By throwing me off a dam? Isnt that a little crude for a genius like you?
And now to kill you. There may be a slight ringing in your ears. Fortunately youll be nowhere near them.	I guess this is it. Thanks anyway.
You know, I could snip the wires. Wed fall to our deaths, but wed save the entire town. Bart, how would you like to do something incredibly noble?	Do we have to?
You -- you saved my life, Bart.	Yeah... I guess this means you cant ever try to kill me again, huh?
Quiet, Lou. Or I will bust you down to sergeant so fast itll make your head spin.	Heh, funny, isnt it, Lis? Those people down there have no idea how close they came to complete destruction.
That concludes our service. All right. I have two announcements. Friday you will have the chance to party down in the church basement to the Jesus-rock stylings of Testament. Thats Friday, six p.m. sharp.	All the best bands are affiliated with Satan.
Going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.	Why you wearing it now?
You look so glamorous, Mom! Oh, and you smell like vanilla flowers!	And Dad, you look totally classy. You could be Abe Lincolns fathers boss!
Itll be dark.	So whens Grampa getting here to babysit?
Uh, Grampas not coming...	Not Patty and Selma!
Actually, Bart, Lisa is going to be in charge tonight.	What?!
I know shes young, but Lisa has proven herself mature and dependable.	Dad, help me out!
Take it like a man, boy. And do everything your little sister says.	This is an outrage! I am two years and thirty-eight days older than she is! This is the greatest injustice in the history of the world!
Bart, I know youre not wild about having me for a babysitter, but Im not some ogre. I think you will find me fair and fun.	Youre dead.
You should wash up for dinner. To make it fun, you can use the Mr. Bubble -- itll be like giving your fingers a bubble bath!	You are so dead.
Certainly.	More than that.
Certainly.	More.
More.	More.
More.	More.
Uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have.	I didnt say I was gonna eat them. I just wanted to look at them, because theyre so gross. Whats for dessert?
Bart, if you dont want to have a babysitter, maybe you should stop being such a baby.	Oh, Im a baby, huh? Well, then Ill act like a baby.
Oh, Im a baby, huh? Well, then Ill act like a baby.	Ga-ga-goo-goo.
Even babies know how to open and close their mouths. You need a bib.	Oh, baby hate bib. Waah! Waah!
Oh, look, Bart, now you got Maggie all upset!	Relax. Ill give her some ice cream.
Bart, thats coffee ice cream! It has caffeine in it!	Well, I guess thatll make things more interesting for you now, wont it?
Lots more coffee. Are you getting ready for bed, Bart?	I am!
Thats right, I want the 25-foot Italian party sub. And dont skimp on the vinegar. Its time Lisa learned what babysitting Bart Simpson is all about...	Um, yes, Id like to host an A.A. meeting. Tonight, if possible.
Why do you have to make this so hard?	Im using non-violent resistance.
Uch! The idea that you would compare yourself to Mahatma Gandhi...	Who?
Bart, you are going to be in so much trouble when Mom and Dad get home. Now go to bed!	Youre the boss.
I thought I told you to go to bed!	Yeah, right, bread. You said go to bread...
I said go to bed.	Yeah, go to bread.
B-E-D -- BED!	Ohhhhh, bed! Oh. Well, anything you say, sis.
GO TO YOUR BED!	Make me!
Ill make you!	If you want me, you gotta catch me!
Bart, are you okay?!	Uh, yeah, I think so... Its just a bump on my head...
Ew, your arm! Its got extra corners!	Yah! Oh, cool, it must be dislocated or something...
We have to get you to the emergency room!	And get this fixed? Whats the rush? Dont you want everyone to see what a responsible babysitter you were?
Stop it! Stand still! Maybe I can pop it back in.	Oh, no! Im going to preserve the evidence until Mom and Dad get home...
Oh, no! Im going to preserve the evidence until Mom and Dad get home...	And youll never baby-sit again!
Bart! You need first aid! Let me in!	Im afraid youll hurt me again!
What are you doing now?!	Im banging my head! Im going to make the lump even bigger!
Uh, near as we can tell, the boy was studying quietly when the girl, drunk on her own sense of power, beat him silly with a block of frozen lima beans.	Its true!
Hey, Bart. Hows your arm?	Its all right. I was hoping theyd give me one of those steel claws, but whatre ya gonna do?
Its all right. I was hoping theyd give me one of those steel claws, but whatre ya gonna do?	Im... Im sorry I was such a jerk last night. Guess I sort of ruined your babysitting business.
Eh, well, thats okay. I can always sell seeds. Do you want some seeds?	No thanks.
Thats funny. I dont feel stupid.	Hey, everybodys wearing green --
Hey, everybodys wearing green --	Oh, no...
Happy St. Patricks Day, loser!	Ow! Quit it!
Parades just bring out so many emotions in me joy, excitement, looking...	Mom, can I go buy one of those long plastic horns?
Oh, Bart, weve bought those before and you always just throw them out the car window on the ride home.	I get bored with them... but that wont happen this time.
Hey, Homer, aint that your kid on TV?	What are yew lookin at?
What are you looking at? The innocent words of a drunken child. Well, Ill tell you what were looking at, young man a town gone mad. A town whose very conscience was washed away in a tide of beer and green vomit.	Im going down to Moes for a coupla beers.
No.	Aw, rats, another gutter ball! Gee, Homer, you sure do suck tonight!
Cmon, boy, think of a plan.	Im trying, Dad.
Heh, Rex Banner. What a dope.	Yeah. Look at him trying to aim that stupid gun.
Hang on, son!	Dad! Knocking over a gravestone is bad luck!
You see, boy, the real moneys in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism.	Oh, so many wasted nights...
Hey, boy, get crackin! Moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!	Uh, Dad...
Call me Beer Baron.	All the beer from the landfill is gone, Beer Baron. Were out of business.
What on earth happened down there?	One of the stills --
Bart, this is boring.	I guess we could go to Martins party...
I dont know. If were seen there, itll definitely take our social standing down a notch.	Were at what now, three?
Bart!	Uh -- Mrs. K! Hey, its Saturday! Your powers are useless against me.
Relax, Im just here to have fun like everybody else. Dont think of me as a teacher.	Okay. So...
I feel queasy.	Dont stop, Milhouse. Youre so close!
Bart, how come youre not sick?	Eh, I gave my oysters to the cat.
Eh, I gave my oysters to the cat.	Hey, whyd you eat them? I thought you were a vegetarian.
Oh, thank you. Its just brown and water.	So I looked in the window and there it was, the grossest sight I have ever...
What Seymour... Oh... What Principal Skinner means to say, Bart, is that sometimes a little boys imagination can run away with him.	Thats the best you can do? You couldve at least said you were giving her CPR or rehearsing a play.
And there are those who might try to use it against us for their own advantage.	Like me for one.
What do you say, son? You keep our secret and some other student can inherit your gloomy, windblown future.	Deal.
Ill... Ill... Ill go get him right now. Car keys, car keys, car keys.	Stop pushing me. Whats going on?
Do you think they actually filmed this in Atlanta?	I dont know. I dont think its important.
Mother doesnt approve of me dating, so I need you to keep her busy for a few hours while Edna and I sneak out.	Oh, I cant take much more of this.
I collect pictures of cakes that I clip out of the magazines. It all started in 1941, when Good Housekeeping featured a photo of a lovely cake.	You wouldnt happen to have any real cakes around here, would you?
Oh, my, no. I dont care for cake. Too sweet. Now -- this is called a Lady Baltimore cake. At my age, I dont have much saliva left, so youll have to lick my thumb before I can turn the page.	Oh, cant I just turn the page for you?
No. But you can pick out any picture you want to take home with you.	Okay. That one.
No!	Ow!
Bart Simpson! How many times do I have to tell you, no talking! Report to the principals office!	But... But I wasnt...
Mrs. Krabappel, Bart has something he wants to say to you.	I wont say it!
Bart!	Oh... I love you, Edna Krabappel.
Thank you, Bart. That was very sweet. You may sit down now.	Theyre not going to get away with this.
Oh, now Martins scoring off of me. Oh, that is it. Listen up, everybody! Follow me!	Okay crew, set your faces to stunned.
Mmm-hmm, its Mr. Skinner now. Im just a man. Bart, I want to apologize for the awkward position Edna and I put you in. Your... your help made our love possible. I dont know what well do without you. Well, so long.	Wait a second. You dont have to leave just because Superintendent Chalmers told you to.
What are you getting at?	Youve spent your whole life following orders -- from your mother, the army, Superintendent Chalmers. Just this once, man, stand up for yourself.
Willie hears ya, Willie dont care.	Obviously, you two have no experience causing a scene.
Give me that! Bart, this is your father. Do you know where the remote is? I looked all over the house.	Did you check your pocket?
Seymour, youre heaven in Hush Puppies.	Turn the music off!
Im going to go out there, and tell every man, woman and child that I love Edna Krabappel.	Well, thats nice. But first, youve gotta grab their attention. And I think I know how...
What? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Sure. Just, um, you know, keep the lewdness to a minimum.	Im outta here. Skinny, Krabby, catch ya later.
We want to thank you for helping us through a difficult period.	Oh, no problemo. So, I guess now youll be getting married or something, huh?
Well, actually, Seymour and I have decided to break up.	Huh?
No.	Aw, but you seemed like such a good couple.
Yes! My precious CarTOONS! Who pumped Ethyl?!	Oh, how come I never get any mail?
Im sorry, honey. Here, you can have the junk mail.	Gas your termites... Freeze your termites... Zap your termites... Save the termites... Hel-lo.
Gas your termites... Freeze your termites... Zap your termites... Save the termites... Hel-lo.	Dear Occupant Because of your fine credit history, you have been pre-approved for a MoneyBank charge card...
... Bills, bills... Oh a rejection letter from The New Yorker subscription department... Hmm. Who or what is Santos L. Halper?	Wow, my own credit card! Thanks, Santos!
Wow, my own credit card! Thanks, Santos!	A quarter?! Well, youre just the dog that keeps on giving, arencha?
And will there be any more splurging today?	Oh my, yes. Hmm, Ill take that hardbound Radioactive Man collection.
Ah, a superb choice in volume two, Radioactive Man travels through time to defeat Jesse Owens at the 1936 Olympic Games.	Put it all on my credit card, my good man.
Oh, what goods a credit card if you cant even use it?	Order by phone. 1-800 -- Our phone doesnt go up to eight hundred. Unless...
Mom, this is for you 15 pounds of	Vancouver smoked salmon. Here. Smell it!
Bart, where did you get all this stuff?	Let me answer that question with... cookware!
Halogen lamps? Kilim rugs? You cant afford this how can you afford this?	Aw, youve been all edgy and suspicious ever since I gave you those pep pills.
Aw, youve been all edgy and suspicious ever since I gave you those pep pills.	What are you talking about? I dont need pep pills to be suspicious if I want to comment on it Ill comment on it whos gonna stop me, you, Pep pill Boy? Pep Boys pills Beverly Sills oh boy oh boy oh boy uh-oh uh-oh oh boy I gotta start taking those pills again you think youre so great...
What are you talking about? I dont need pep pills to be suspicious if I want to comment on it Ill comment on it whos gonna stop me, you, Pep pill Boy? Pep Boys pills Beverly Sills oh boy oh boy oh boy uh-oh uh-oh oh boy I gotta start taking those pills again you think youre so great...	Cmon, boy, lets go for a walk!
Cmon, boy, lets go for a walk!	No, not you -- Laddie.
Whoa! The crowning achievement of the dogmakers art. This limited edition Collie comes fully trained by Major Jonas Fong, A.L.B.D.A... only 800 will be bred... quite possibly the Worlds Best Dog.	Twelve hundred bucks?! I better just get one.
Twelve hundred bucks?! I better just get one.	Hey, where are you going?
Hey, where are you going?	Hello, my name is Laddie. Ive been trained to gather fruit for you as a welcome gift.
Good dog.	Okay, watch this. Watch. Do a back-flip, Laddie!
In a truth-telling contest. Right, Bart?	Uh, to the best of my recollection, yes.
Oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day.	Hes trained to do all sorts of stuff. He can herd sheep and perform CPR.
Geez, that dog has more education than I do. Hes some kinda super dog. Hey, whered he go?	Hullo?
Hello, Mr. Halper, Im calling from MoneyBank Credit Services Department. I was wondering if you had a chance to read the threatening letter we sent you...	Uhh...
No.	Cmon, Ive got a job for you.
Oh no, repo men. Laddie, hide behind that bush there.	Mom and Dad arent home, are they?
No. They went for a walk with the Flanders. Bart, whats going on? Why are these repo guys taking all your stuff?	The dog and I got a credit card and...
A credit card? Oh, I knew you were up to no good.	Okay, so I committed a little mail fraud. Havent I been punished enough?
Well, is he the dog or isnt he?	Yeah, thats him all right.
Yeah, thats him all right.	Sorry, boy. I didnt plan this. It just sort of happened.
Sorry, boy. I didnt plan this. It just sort of happened.	Mom, can I feed Laddie at the table?
Who?	Um, I took him to a kennel... two towns over. Just til the new dog gets settled.
Besides, hes happy just hanging around the house with Bart.	Uh, yeah.
Boy, Bart. Laddies the best dog in the world. Hes nothing like your old dog.	Santas Little Helper? I guess I was the only one who loved him.
You got that right. Remember the time he ate my goldfish and you lied to me and said I never had any goldfish? But whyd I have the bowl, Bart? Why did I have the bowl?	Yeah, he was a great dog.
Nah, thats not too likely.	But still... youre gone. Oh, where are you, boy?
But still... youre gone. Oh, where are you, boy?	Time for a walk. Again? We gotta find out where hes keeping these.
Help! Help!	Now what?! Cmon, I wanna go home.
So Laddie, thank you for your heroic rescue, and Baby Gerald, we cant help but wonder what mischief youll get into next.	Now can we go home?
Laddie saved the day, Simpson. Boy, we sure could use a dog like that on the force.	Why dont you guys take him. I thought he was the right dog for me, but I guess I made a mistake.
Laddie?	Uh, Dad? Laddies not coming. I gave him away.
Whats the matter, Bart? Werent you happy with him?	No. He just wasnt the right dog for me. Im sure hell be happy as a police dog.
Well, if thats what you think is best, lets just go down to the kennel and get Santas Little Helper back.	We cant. Hes not in a kennel. I gave him away, too, and I dont know where he is.
You gave both dogs away?! You know how I feel about giving!	Im sorry, I know its wrong. I messed everything up and now I dont have any dogs at all.
There, there, shut up, boy. Well just get you a new dog.	I dont want a new dog. I want Santas Little Helper.
Well, crying isnt going to bring him back, unless your tears smell like dog food. So you can either sit there, crying and eating can after can of dog food until your tears smell enough like dog food to make your dog come back, or you can go out there and find your dog!	Youre right. Ill do it.
Rats. I almost had him eating dog food.	Im going to get the dog back.
The bad dog or the good dog?	The bad dog.
But I dont want to!	Excuse me, sir. Did you repossess this dog from a guy named Santos L. Halper?
Yeah, I ate his little face. I ate his guts. And I ate the way hes always barking... so I gave him to the church.	Oh, I see. You hate him, so you gave him to the church.
He unholied the Holy Water!	Thats him all right. Ill be happy to take him off your hands.
Oh, Im afraid thats impossible, Bart. Hes no longer among us.	You didnt crucify him?
Yes?	My name is Bart Simpson. I have to talk to you about your dog.
Give me one minute.	Okay, showtime!
Okay, showtime!	Please, mister...  No, let me do that again. Please, mister... please?!
Hi there. How can I help you?	Youre the guy who owns the dog?
Yup, his name is Sprinkles!	Sprinkles?!
Polly, wanna say Hi to our guest? Huh? Fine, be that way. Now, what can I do ya for, son?	Oh, nothin. Forget it.
Bart, that is a new low.	Hey, Im not saying its gonna be a dance around the maypole.
Well, I wont tell Mom and Dad, but only because I want the dog back. Just try not to freak out the blind man.	I cant promise Ill try. But Ill try to try.
Psst!	Oh, I missed you so much, boy! Cmon, lets get outta here! Now keep quiet, okay?
Sprinkles?! Is there somebody down there?!	Cmon, boy. Lets blow.
Hey, burglar! I hope youre having a good time in there, cause the police will be here any minute!	No, mister! Please, Im just a kid. I... I only came to get my dog back.
Your dog?	...and I miss him so much and I know you like him but I like him too and he was mine first and I know I dont deserve him but...
So what this comes down to is you want a blind man to give up his only companion.	Yes, please.
Cmon, Sprinkles! Here, Sprinkles!	Cmon, Santas Little Helper! Im sorry I ever let you go! Pick me! Please pick me!
Cmon, Santas Little Helper! Im sorry I ever let you go! Pick me! Please pick me!	Attaboy! I knew youd come! Gimme a kiss! Oh, yeah!
Sounds like you won. Congratulations.	Oh geez, Im sorry. I wish there was some way we could both have a dog.
Eh, this might take awhile, kid. Why dont you and your buddy run along?	Bye, Laddie.
Oh, its for my Junior Achievers Club. Were trying to earn money by recycling.	Aw, recycling is useless, Lis. Once the sun burns out, this planet is doomed. Youre just making sure we spend our last days using inferior products.
And you have to cut these up first. Otherwise animals get caught in them.	Only the stupid ones.
You told me about that candy bar you found three times!	You found a candy bar?
See that, boy? Why arent you making any business deals?	Ill do it this afternoon...
Oh, dont congratulate me, congratulate Bay State Fish Sticks... as my advisor, youre entitled to ten percent of the proceeds.	Lis, have I told you lately that I love you?
Cinq, quatre, trois...deux, un... MAINTENANT!	Turn it down! We dont wanna wake up mom and dad!
Its your life.	Well bring you back something nice.
Oh my God! Help me, Lisa!	Lisa! Dad! Cmere quick! There is something that you wont believe!
What the heck is that?	Maybe its a box from the future!
But Marge, Im obsessed with it! Where did it come from? What is it a box of? Howd my face get on it?!	Hey, if they got a picture of you, that means they can see you. Theyre probably watching us right now.
Mista Sparkaru -- Un no yoi besto washu!!	Bor-ing.
Hey, it was all a coincidence!	Yep. Theres your answer, Fish Bulb.
Well, it was a good ride while it lasted. Cmon kids. Lets go home.	We are home.
No, run around in circles!	No, act like a lion!
Geez, Id like to, but if they dont kill the intruder, its really bad for their society...	Theyre gonna kill him?
Say your prayers, you heathen baboons!	Wow.
Hmmm... NITZI...	Im outta here.
Ladies and gentlemen our next lot is number Seven Fifty-One. How much am I bid for Item Seven Fifty-One -- Seven Five One? Nothing? No bids for Item Seven Fifty-One?	A buck!
I have a buck. I have one dollar, one dollar here one dollar one here one dollar do I have two? Sold for a buck!	Cool! Whatd I buy?
You dont have a factory.	Hey, Im a busy man. You want a job or not?
Im saying youre whats wrong with America, Simpson. You coast through life, you do as little as possible and you leech off decent, hard-working people like me. Ha. If you lived in any other country in the world youd have starved to death long ago.	Hes got you there, Dad.
Wow! Adding machines! Industrial waste! What should we do with all this stuff, Bart?	I think we both know the answer to that..
I think we both know the answer to that..	Get to work.
Get to work.	Wacky shack!
Better be careful, Bart. Look at those warning signs.	Solve your problem, Milhouse?
Oh, boy! Quittin time!	Just a minute, Van Houten. Somebody needs to guard this place tonight so it doesnt get trashed. Howd you like to be night watchman?
But, Im sleepy.	Ah, no problemo. Heres a nickel for the coffee machine.
So this is my life... At least Ive done better than Dad.	Aw, geez!
Aw, geez!	Milhouse, how could you let this happen? You were supposed to be the night watchman.
I was watching. I saw the whole thing. First it started falling over. Then it fell over.	Wow. I wonder where all the rats are gonna go.
Well, if it isnt my old friends from Springfield, the Simpsons! What brings you folks to New Orleans?	Mardi Gras, man! When the Big Easy calls, ya gotta accept the charges!
REMEMBER ME? MY NAME IS MARGE! / THE TV MOM WHOSE HAIR IS LARGE!	STEP BACK, MOM! ITS BARTS TURN NOW! / EAT MY SHORTS! DONT HAVE A COW!
IM LISA -- PEPPY, BLONDE, AND STUNNING! / SOPHOMORE PROM QUEEN FIVE YEARS RUNNING! GOOOOOO LISA!	Wait a minute! Whoa, whoa! Stop the music! Wheres Dad?
Stakes!	Hey, would you two close the dam door?
Bart!	But thats where we live -- a dam.
But dont you want to end world famine?	I WANT CANDY!
Well, thats all the time we have. So this is the Simpson family saying As you walk down the road of life...	Hitchhike -- its faster!
Ahhhhh... Ohhhhh... I wont be getting up soon.	Testing...
Testing...	Testing...
Testing...	Hmm. Hmm. Hey...
Now, about your punishment, young man.	I know, Ill go to my room and think about what I did.
No, no! Your room is full of toys. Youre going to the, uh, garage!	Youre the boss.
You know, maybe Chief Wiggum is right. Military school is a good idea.	Wow, I cant believe were going to Disneyland! Hey, wheres all your luggage?
Fortunately, weve had a couple of recent freak-outs, so that freed up a couple of bunks.	Freak-outs?
Well, he sure sucked the fun out of that poem.	Please dont make me stay, Dad! Ill do anything you say! Ill find religion! Ill be good sometimes!
Leggo my leg.	No!
Lisa, no! This place is just a jail for children.	No jail can hold me!
Lisa, if you ever want to quit and come home, Ill be here in half a jiff.	I want to quit and come home.
I want to quit and come home.	I want to quit and come home.
Hey, look, its the school motto.	Ill die before I surrender, Tim. Whos Tim?
Apparently Tim was someone who was with the general moments before he was shot right in the head.	Cleaning graffiti off a statue makes a mockery of everything I stand for. I dont think I can survive here, Lis.
Four out of five, Simpson. Impressive, but you missed your last target.	Did I?
Bart, I got a cassette from Mom and Dad! I thought we could listen to it together.	Gee, Lis, Id love to, but this really isnt a good time...
Bart, who you talking to?	Uh...
Lisa. Youre talking to Lisa.	Im talking to... no one.
YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE, MY ONLY SUNSHINE / YOU MAKE ME HAPPY, WHEN SKIES ARE GRAY / YOULL NEVER KNOW, DEAR / HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU / SO DONT TAKE MY SUNSHINE AWAY...	Im sorry I froze you out, Lis. I--I just didnt want the guys to think Id gone soft on the girl issue.
Ech, Im tired of being an issue, Bart. Maybe everyone would be better off if I just quit.	But if you quit, itll be like an expert knot-tier quitting a knot-tying contest right in the middle of tying a knot!
Whyd you say that?	I dunno. I was just looking at my shoelaces. Look, the point is, youre going to make it, Lis. And Im going to stick by you.
Dont do that. Why should we both be outcasts?	Then Ill just stick by you in secret. Like a sockmaker secretly working on a top secret sock that...
Well, cadets, its been a great year. Youve all worked very hard developing academic skills, and general killing skills.	My killing teacher says Im a natural.
Meet me at The Eliminator after lights out. P.S. The cadets are planning to throw their meatballs at you.	Thats it, Lis. Now start crawling.
I cant do this, Bart. Im not strong enough.	I thought you came here looking for a challenge.
It was worth sneaking into town. That was some good corn.	Uh-oh.
Hey, Simpson, what are you doing out here?	Nothin.
Nothing?! Doesnt look like nothing!	Oh yeah? Well, um... what are you doing out here?
Uh... also nothing.	Well. Okay.
Okay!	Then carry on.
All right, we will!	That was close.
Bees. Bees.	Bees! Yaargh!
Yes! You thought I couldnt but I could I did! and I could do it again lets do it again!	Lisa, its over, you made it. You can put your arms down.
Well, Bart, uh, did you make sure to return all the guns?	Sir, yes sir! Luckily, I am now trained in six additional forms of unarmed combat, sir!
Dad, you cant judge a place youve never been to.	Yeah! Thats what people do in Russia!
Aw, Id love to see New York. We could all go with the bus companys special Supersitter Fare!	Nine bucks?! This ones on me.
Its wall-to-wall landmarks -- the Williamsburg Bridge! Fourth Avenue! Governors Island!	Look, its ZZ Top! You guys rock!
Wow, Governors Island looks so insignificant from up here.	Hey immigrants, beat it! Countrys full!
Hey, wheres Bart?	Ladies and Gentlemen, Im sorry to disturb your pleasant ride, but unlike yourselves, I was born without taste buds. Let me demonstrate.
Ladies and Gentlemen, Im sorry to disturb your pleasant ride, but unlike yourselves, I was born without taste buds. Let me demonstrate.	Im in over my head here. Thank you for your time.
Bart, no fireworks! Put that back!	Youre the boss.
If only I didnt already have a pair of shoes.	Speaking of shoes, I dont care about shoes. Ill meet you ladies back here in half an hour.
No, its Mademoiselle. Were buying our sign on the installment plan.	Uh, seriously, though -- my name is Bart Simpson. My father has a subscription. Id like the grand tour, please.
Listen, kid. You probably think lots of crazy stuff goes on in there , but this is just a place of business.	Oh. Okay.
And wheres my furshlugginer pastrami sandwiches?!	Woooooow. I will never wash these eyes again.
CHUCK IT OUT! YOURE CHECKING IN!	When I grow up, I want to be in the Betty Ford Center.
Ow!	Hey, its Dad! Right on time!
Bart? Why are you doing that?	Our class is making refreshments for Skinners party. These are in honor of his Army days.
Uh huh, that explains the flags. What about the dog food?	My theory is, Skinner likes dog food.
Now, I know the school normally serves cake only on Thursdays. And Im also well aware that today is Friday. Nevertheless, I have a surprise for you.	I hope you all brought forks and plates!
Some people might call that a pretty corny dream. Sergeant.	Principal Skinner?
And when they told us he was missing, presumed dead, my future died, once again. My life lost all meaning.	Come on! Get to the part where you steal his identity!
Ech, Im trying to explain how emotionally fragile I was.	Oh, its one of those stories.
I wont hear of it. Tonight you can sleep on the floor of your office.	Hey, Armin.
Oh, now, Bart, you know thats wrong.	Well, I dont see how me signing Homers name is any different from you using Sgt. Skinners name.
I guess my punishing you would be somewhat hypocritical. Why dont you just write a thirty word essay on what youve done.	Hey, hey, hey! Easy there, you big impostor.
I admit Sgt. Skinner seems okay... but Mr. Tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration.	He lied about his name.
His name doesnt matter. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.	Not if you called em stench blossoms.
Thank you, Chalmers. You know, where I come from, theres no better way to get acquainted than by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance together. Why dont you lead us, son?	Hey America, youre so fine. Youre so fine, you blow my mind. America.
Hey there, Meathead. What are you watchin?	Oh, I thought Id check out the Warner Brothers Network.
I went through a five year orgy of non-stop pills and booze with nothing to show for it but four Emmys and a Peabody Award!	All right! Theyre gonna show his disastrous marriage to Mia Farrow!
Look, Bart. I have to practice my saxophone and you cant stop me.	Oh yeah? My dear Lisa, you are eight and I am ten. And in my two extra years on this planet, Ive learned a few tricks. Gimme that sax!
No!	I said gimme!
Lisa, honey, if itll make you feel better Ill destroy something Bart loves.	Hey!
Ooh, theres the bus. Goodbye, sweetheart!	School will be fun!
THERE WAS A FARMER HAD A DOG / AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O!	B-I- -O
B-I- -O	B-I---O
B-I---O	B-I-
B-I-	AND BINGO WAS HIS NAME-O!
And that, my children, is the story of Barts first day of school.	Very nice.
Mom!	Hey, shes just giving the public what it wants. Bart by the barrel ful.
D.	D, E... Um... line?
Bart, would you like to read a book?	No.
Would you like to color something?	I did.
Bart, son. You wanna play catch?	No.
Our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. Bart was miserable at school, and Lisas gifts were going to waste.	Uh, Homer? Its five years later and Im still miserable at school.
And the ugly duckling was amazed to realize it had grown into a beautiful swan! So you see children, there is hope for anyone.	Even me?
Uh... hi.	Hi.
I have soy milk. The doctor says the real kind could kill me.	I wish I was interesting like you.
Youre funny.	I am?
Yeah, and the world needs a clown.	Hm...
Hm...	Doody. Booger.
Man, that is killer material.	Skinner is a nut! He has a rubber butt!
Now, I want you to knock off that potty talk right now.	The principal said potty!
You listen to me, son. Youve just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life. Now what do you say?	Eat my shorts!
All right, Ill eat--eat your shorts?!	Yeah, eat my shorts. Buttman... da da da da da da da da... Buttman.
...and that inscription is still there today.	Wow. So thats how Lisa got her sax.
Ohhhh, but Marge! Am I doomed to spend the rest of my life sweating like a pig?	Yeah, not to mention lookin like a pig, eatin like a pig...
Hes crazy.	Hey Einstein , how much for the mood pants?
It was your mother.	Okay, cat. Now, if this works, your next trip will be to the bank vault.
Whoa, cool! Twice the pet and none of the mess.	Ohh. Uhl. You can be Lisas.
Ohh. Uhl. You can be Lisas.	Hmm...
Hmm...	Look in the sky! Its Superfly!
Look in the sky! Its Superfly!	Id be stupid not to do this.
Id be stupid not to do this.	It worked! I was hoping to be humongous. Oh well, at least I dont have two butts.
Whats going on down there? Whats all this mist?	Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.	Oh! Ow! Uh!
Eh, itll turn up somewhere.	Help me! Help meeeee!
Help me! Help meeeee!	Sucker!
Okay, okay. Its your sugar, Bart.	That imposter!
That imposter!	Mom! Dad! Im the real Bart! Thats just some overgrown fly with my body! Somebody listen to me!
Mm! Shoo! Shoo, fly!	Listen, buddy -- this is all a mistake. If youll just go through the transporter with me again, well have you back eating garbage in no time.
I cant hear you. Wait! Fly into my saxophone!	Help me, Lis! That giant fly stole my body, and now hes trying to kill me!
Get my filthy hands off my sister!	Whoa! No! Dont eat me! You dont know where Ive been!
Well, there must be someone here we can accuse.	Lisa Simpson!
Bart, quit it!	She put a spell on me!
She put a spell on me!	Must-drop-pantaloons.
The Continental Soccer Association is coming to Springfield! Its all here. Fast kickin, low scorin, and ties? You bet!	Hey, Dad, how come youve never taken us to see a soccer game?
Its hard to believe this used to be an internment camp.	Yo Paella Man! Wing one up here!
Somebodys gotta stop them!	Lets wait until they burn the school down.
That would have made a lot more sense.	Hey Dad, can I borrow the gun tomorrow? I want to scare that old security guard at the bank.
You want me to get the cat down?	Missed one, Dad.
Does anyone know where all my dinner plates went?	Uhmm...
And Im a wonderful man.	I dont feel them.
You said thered be fudge-icles, Bart. Wheres the fudge-icles?	First, its fudge-cicle... And I know theyre up there. I just need a better foothold.
First, its fudge-cicle... And I know theyre up there. I just need a better foothold.	Hello.
Hello.	And the next marksman is... William Tell, Jr.!
Lookin for a good time, sailor?	I certainly am.
Not right now, dear.	Wow! The TVs coin-operated.
And so is the Bible!	Id like to order a wake-up call, please... three AM... ah, for every room except this one... thats right. Goodnight.
Id like to order a wake-up call, please... three AM... ah, for every room except this one... thats right. Goodnight.	Always love tryin out new material on the road.
Always love tryin out new material on the road.	No way are you gonna to beat me this time, Lis!
Yes I am! Come on, Spotty!	Come on, Smelly!
Hey, Tubby. Want another Pop-Tart, Tubby?	Im comfortable with who I am.
There you go, Bart, Pee Wee Football will melt away those unsightly pounds and inches.	Yeah, but I could get seriously hurt.
Okay, Milhouse, lets try out the new cup.	Again.
And, uh, Bart, youll be a tackle.	Cool!
Okay, Simpson, youre blocking for me on this play.	All right!
Hut, hut, hike, hike, HUT!	Its clobberin time.
You okay, Bart?	Yeah.
Wipe that smile off your face.	What did I do?
Im tired of watching you dog it on that football field. From now on, Im gonna work you like a dog. Now go fetch me twenty laps.	Oh, man.
Its gotta be a trick. Run like the wind.	But, Coach?
What is it, sweetie?	Nelsons a great quarterback. Hes carryin this team!
Son, you can do anything you want. I have total faith in you.	Since when?
Since your mother yelled at me. Now how bout that hug?	Dad, the car!
Not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, Flanders?	Ready. Set. Hut, hut!
Ready. Set. Hut, hut!	Yahh!
Great debut, son. You really settled in after some early jitters.	Are you kidding? I reeked!
Hey, everybody! Lets hear it for Bart!	Gimme a B?
Excuse me, son.	Wow, Joe Namath!
Thats right. My car broke down in front of your house.	I cannot believe you are here! Do you think, maybe, you could give me some pointers?
Ah, oops. Hey, look, I gotta run. Remember what I told ya.	Okay, Bart. Concentrate.
It was just vapor lock... vapor lock... vapor lock... vapor lock...	Im dead.
Well, I know you dont want to disappoint Dad, but how do you feel about lying to him?	Good.
Ah, you guys are some k...	Dad, Ive got some bad news.
Ohh, your Mothers not pregnant, is she?	No, I got hit by a couple of cars. I wont be able to play today.
Come on, guys. We cant play without Bart. Hes the heart of this team!	No, Im not. I suck.
Dont listen to them, son. I have total faith in you.	You dont get it, do you? I dont want to be your stupid quarterback! I quit!
Well, at least Im making conversation.	May I be excused, Mom?
Ive got lots of quarters.	This thing only takes dollars.
Aww... You know, tomorrows the championship game and I could sure use a good offensive tackle.	But I thought Uter took my place.
Oh no, my quarterback. What are we gonna do?	Its okay Dad, I can fill in for Nelson.
You know what you did, Muntz. Burglary and arson. Youre goin away for a long time.	Wuh?
Good evening, Im Kent Brockman. Our top story Hunks, and lots of em! And all to raise money for the Springfield Fire Department to buy a fire engine, so they can get to fires.	Lazy bums.
Whats the deal with that dot?	Yeah, can you see out of it? Does it change colors when youre ticked off?
You tell me.	Nothing yet.
Surely, you children are aware of your Brahman heritage.	As long as you have absolutely no follow-up questions... yes. Yes, we are.
Ive been looking over this list of things for the ceremony. Ive got the extra wine glasses, but Im still short a tandoori oven, an elephant, and four castrati.	Whats a castrati?
Why is that woman still living here?	I unno.
Hows that fire ring coming? Is it sacred yet?	Almost...
Hey!	Tradition.
Hello, everyone... What a happy, happy day.	Wow! I wish I had an elephant.
You did. His name was Stampy. You loved him.	Oh, yeah.
Up, up and away, in my beautiful, my beautiful motor boattt... Da-da-da-da-da.	But we didnt enter any police raffle.
Ill just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.	Its probably a million years old, Dad. I think its as valuable as its gonna get.
Ugh, I wish Id never found those stupid bones! Its time to put an end to this. Bart, Im borrowing your blue crowbar.	Good ol Bluey.
Oh-ho, no! This cant be happening! What the hell are we gonna do with ten thousand angel ashtrayyys?	I could take up smoking.
What?! She didnt do anything.	Give her a nice cell. Somethin in C block.
Why are we getting dressed up, Mom? Are we going to Black Angus?	So were not going to Black Angus.
Dont worry, Mom. Well help you study.	Course, well have to cut back on our own homework.
So, youre married and youre looking for your first house, Mr. and Mrs...	Superman.
Oh, dont listen to my husband. Hes just an idiot. Now, Im a veterinarian and I need to keep lots of sick animals in my house. Is that permitted?	Not in my damn house.
On the closing day!/ The escrow agents pay!/ Taxes, liens, and interest, too, thanks to Fannie Mae!	They back your baaaannk!
What about me? You didnt thank me.	You didnt do anything.
I thought so too, but they said it sells.	Works for the Lumber King.
So long, Simpsons!	So long! / Good-bye! / Good luck!
Well, Im proud of you, Mom. You refused to compromise your integrity.	Yeah, you did the right thing... eventually.
Hey, kids, I made your favorite cookies -- Christmas trees for the girls, and bloody spear-heads for Bart.	Aww, thanks, Mom.
Bart, did you hear that?	Could it be...?
Cmon, kids. Lets try the lights!	Its crap-tacular.
Its crap-tacular.	Hocus-pocus, mucus-pukus... My powers of deduction tell me youre getting a hand-made sweater. Possiblyyy yellow.
Hallooo? Anybody home?	Ah, 12 glasses of water. Thatll wake me up nice and early, and Ill have a big head-start on opening presents. Pure genius.
You didnt invent that, Bart. The Indians used to drink water to wake up early for their attacks.	Its always about the Indians, isnt it, Lis?
Its always about the Indians, isnt it, Lis?	Dear Santa. If you bring me lotsa good stuff, I promise not to do anything bad between now and when I wake up. Amen.
Dear Santa. If you bring me lotsa good stuff, I promise not to do anything bad between now and when I wake up. Amen.	Owww! Ill kill you!

Uh-oh.	Eep.
Dad...	Snow covers all. Pure, white snow.
Snow covers all. Pure, white snow.	I gotta get back to bed!
Bart, what were you doing outside?	I dont know how to tell you this, but... I came down a little early and... um... well... uh...
I dont know how to tell you this, but... I came down a little early and... um... well... uh...	I saw - a burglar and he was - he took - and he got all our stuff. Including the tree.
We were robbed?	Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh.
How could somebody...?	I know...
Now, um, what did this, ah, Christmas thief look like?	Well, he had a glass eye, a wooden leg, um... big scar on his cheek...
Anything unusual?	Hooks for hands. Um, oh, uh, and he was wearing a striped convict shirt. And he was carrying a big sack with a dollar sign on it.
Well, theres no easy way to say it, kids God hates us.	Hey, since when is Christmas just about the presents? Arent we forgetting the true meaning of this day? The birth of Santa?
Poor Violet.	Ohhh, I dont like where this is goin.
Your story made everyone at the orphanage so sad. We want you to have this dollar we were saving.	Please, I dont deserve this.
What a deal! Id be a sucker not to get it.	I dont know about this, Dad. Shouldnt we give the money to charity or some...? Ow!
Oh, Im sorry. I jabbed you with my pen.	Ow! Youre still doing it.
Here comes Santa Claus / Here comes Santa Claus / Right down Santa Claus Lane... Vixen and Blitzen all the reindeer pulling at the reins... / Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh...	Will this Christmas never end?
Turn into the skid!	No, away from the skid!
No, away from the skid!	Hit the brakes! / Floor it! / Stop! / To the left! / Head back!
Bart! Youre up early.	I couldnt sleep.
Whats wrong?	There was no burglar.
No burglar? / What? / whats he mean?	I accidentally burned up the tree and the presents. Im really sorry.
Oh, its true! We werent robbed! That part we made up! But the rest is true!	Wait! Hes just covering for me! I destroyed the presents, then I buried the evidence. And I acted alone.
I think theyre running out of tomatoes.	Yeah, but theyve still got plenty of pumpkins.
But we would have had each other anyway.	Yeah. Plus lots of other stuff.
Maybe so. But theres one thing they forgot to take away from us. This washcloth.	Hey, thats my washcloth.
Hey!	Head her off at the stairs!
Im over here!	Shes going around the other side. Now get her!
Something very close, exactly along those lines--A Clint Eastwood - Lee Marvin shoot em up western!	So prepare yourself, for the bloody mayhem and unholy carnage of Joshua Logans, Paint Your Wagon!
Theyre singing! Theyre singing, Marge! Why arent they killing each other?	Yeah, their guns are right there!
NO I DONT, I THINK THEYRE BAD / THEYRE FAKE AND PHONEY AND TOTALLY WRONG.	WAKE UP DAD / YOURE SINGING A SONG!

Thats a good suggestion, Mom.	Well take it under advisement.
Well take it under advisement.	But I cant go out dressed like this! What if someone sees me?
Aw, man. Look at all this stuff Pull weeds, mow lawn, scoop and bag dog business...	Theres gotta be a way out of this. Lisa, chop off my hands!
No! Then whod chop off my hands?	All right, you chop my hands half way off and then Ill still have enough strength to chop...
Kids, I made some lemonade for you.	Sounds great.
What the? What are you doing inside?	Work was hard, so we quit.
Okay. We get our room and board free anyway.	And Santy Claus provides the rest.

Oh. Bart?	Yeah, Dad?
Do I like chicken?	Does it matter?
Okay. Simpson, you and your boyll be taking over the ring toss.	Dad, were saved!
Do whatever it takes. Sweet talk, insults, slang from the 30s that no one uses anymore...	Like rubes?

Youre failing, Seymour. What is it about you and failure?	Were natural born carnies, Dad. If only we werent tied down with a family...
I understand.	Um, hey, Dad, I, I think he wants a...
Look at em, Bart. If a carny can wind up homeless, it can happen to anyone.	Im goin for a corn dog. You want one?
Heres a little trick my grandmother taught me.	Wow. Can you do that again?
Aw hell, the Cooders have been carnies ever since we came here in 1620, clingin to the side of the Mayflower.	Thanks for dinner, Mom. I love you.
Aw, arent you sweet? Hey, my pearls!	Spud taught me that.
I wonder how that happened?	Hey, come on, Sharky. / Hey, you want a piece of this? / You call yourself the king of the jungle? / Etc.
Hey, someones boarded up our windows!	Check this out!
Bart, youre brushing your teeth with my twig.	So. I let you use my leaves.
We cant just give up our home. Theres gotta be a way to get those guys out of there.	I say we set fire to the house. Kill em that way.

Im so proud of you, Homer. You got us our house back.	Way to go, Dad. You actually outwitted someone.
Look at em standing out there. No place to go. Heh, heh. Poor guys. Hey, what if we let em stay here for just a few days?	Mom. Get him away from the window.
And what are you charging for this free weekend?	Cmon, Dad! The teams arriving!
What? What did I say?	Church, cult. Cult, church. So we get bored someplace else every Sunday. Does this really change our day-to-day lives?
Dad and all these other people are obviously the products of mental conditioning.	Yeah, maybe itll wear off. Like his interest in C.B. radio.
Thats a negatory, good buddy!	I kinda think its cool. Just pretend youre in a zombie movie. Besides, this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc.
I kinda think its cool. Just pretend youre in a zombie movie. Besides, this is just another place for me to wreak my special brand of hysterical havoc.	These rubes in robes havent met the likes of Bart Simpson before.
These rubes in robes havent met the likes of Bart Simpson before.	I love the Leader.
And who can tell me where thunder and lightning come from? Yes, Bart?	The Leader, Maam.
Very good, Bart. And who invented Morse code?	Oh, I should know this one. Th--The Leader?
Oh ho, Im afraid I played a dirty part in this little charade.	Well, can we at least keep the bikes?
And hes going to take us to a wonderful new planet.	Does anyone here like food?
Its wonderful to think for ourselves again.	You said it, sister.
Ooh, its so late. You kids have to go to bed.	But the floods only knee-high! At least let us watch til the midgets drown.
Yeah, Mom, cmon. You let us stay up to watch Troy McClure in such other bible epics as David vs. Super Goliath and Suddenly, Last Supper.	Go, Lis! Way to cite precedent! Ah ha!
Okay, delegates. You leave tomorrow for the statewide model U.N., so this is our last chance to bone up. And bone we will.	Lighten up, Lis.

O-okay, Libya. Exports.	Yes, sir, you American pig.
Nice touch.	Ah, uh-hum. Lets see. Ah. The exports of Libya are numerous in amount. One thing they export is corn...
Ah, uh-hum. Lets see. Ah. The exports of Libya are numerous in amount. One thing they export is corn...	Or as the Indians call it, maize. Another famous Indian was Crazy Horse. In conclusion, Libya is a land of contrasts. Thank you.
Point of order. If we want to learn anything, we must respect...	Point of odor. Lisa stinks.
Hey, Simpson -- race ya!	First one to the front of the bus gets Martins lunch money.

How many monkey butlers will there be?	One at first. But hell train others.
Cool! / Yeah! / Monkey butlers! / Etc.	Good, lets get to work. Me and Nelson will build the treehouse. Martin, draw up plans for a coconut radio and, if possible, a coconut Nintendo system.
What about the rest of us?	You guys gather food for the big feast tonight. And maybe a little wine for the older kids.
Delicious wine?	Exactly.
Food patrol, were all starved. Lets see what youve got.	Thats it? What happened to all the lobsters, mangoes and chewy chewy cocoa beans?
I eated the purpleberries.	How are they, Ralph? Good?
They taste like burning.	Okay, food patrol blew it.
Yeah? Well, your tree house looks kinda crummy, too. Kinda really crummy.	Well, when monsoon season comes, youll be glad its there.
Well, when monsoon season comes, youll be glad its there.	Oh. No food, no shelter, no monkey butlers... This island is a death-hole. We shouldve just swum for it like Otto.
Its the monster!	No its not, its my tummy. I mean stomach. Gut. Crap factory.
Wait a minute... We had a cooler full of snacks on the bus.	Hey, yeah! And I think I know how I can get it.
Uhm, is this cage really necessary?	No talking in the cage. Court is now in session. All rise.
No talking in the cage. Court is now in session. All rise.	Ah-ha! Made you rise.
Monster? Oh, please.	I remind you, we are not here to debate the existence of monsters.
I rest my case.	Prosecutor, your witness.
Object-Objection! Hes not asking any questions!	Hmm. Im gonna allow this.
Prosecution rests.	After careful deliberation, its my opinion that Milhouse probably did eat the food. But since theres no proof, I must find him not guilty.
Stop! Leave Milhouse alone! Help me out here, Bart.	I dont know, Lis... to be honest, that verdict made me pretty angry.
Barts with us, law girl! Step aside!	Hey, man! Leave my sister alone!
Hurry! Theyre catching up!	Here, Milhouse, you go first.
Here, Milhouse, you go first.	Oh. Gee thanks, mister.
Oh. Gee thanks, mister.	Okay, now throw the vine back!
Your monster appears to be nothing but a run-of-the-mill wild boar.	Hey, look at his tusk!
More snout, anyone?	Mmm. Mm. Hows your dinner, Lis?
Would you mind lacing them up, kid? I have a bad back.	Hey, if you didnt wanna tie shoes, you shouldnt a become a shoe salesman.
Perfect. Youll grow into them.	When?
Now thats a fight I wanna be a part of.	Hey, somebody screwed up bad! Youve got all these big comics lined up for your show, but theres no Krusty.
Who?	Krusty the Clown!
Krusty the Clown!	Funniest man alive? Prince of Pies? The Sultan of Seltzer?
Yeah, just jokin. I-Im Jay Leno.	Oh.
So what can I do for ya, huh?	Well, if youre running the show, how could you leave out, Krusty the Clown?
Ah, Krusty the Clown. That takes me back. Didnt he die in a grease fire?	No, hes alive. And he is so funny you could plotz. At least according to his press release.
He seems reluctant.	Tell him itll count towards his community service.
Its time for something special, the man Spencer Tracy called the most promising newcomer of 1959, please put your hands together for, Krusty the Clown!	Woo hoo! Yeah! Krust-ee!
Ah so. Ah so. Me lika da flied lice... Me flappa dickey long time...	Hey Krusty, great set.
Are you kidding? I stunk up the joint.	No! No, I was talkin to Lisa back there, we both agreed you killed.
Really? Lisa, huh?	Oh sure, there were a lotta laughs. Y-You probably couldnt hear em, the acoustics were so bad.
Hey, hey. Im Kent Brockman the Clown, filling in for Krusty the Clown, who didnt come in today. He is presumed dead or on vacation. Todays top joke... It seems a local moron threw his clock out the window. Well tell you why, right after this...	Oh, this sucks. I am outta here.
No, lets poke him a little while longer.	Hey! Get away from him, you little freaks!
Not you, you imbecile.	Oh, pew! What were ya drinkin? Gasoline?
Yes, I was drinking gasoline, Mother.	Uh, Krusty...
Hang on kid, I got a tack in my head.	Thats one of your posters. I got all the Krusty stuff.
Ah! Ah! That burns! What the hells on those things?	Here, here, quick! Use my Krusty eyewash!
No! Not on your life!	Thanks for comin over, Jay. Krusty really needs help.
Yes! Now stop squirming. Im trying to get these tangles out.	They are just impossible.
They are just impossible.	Well, they are! Anyway, dont you have some advice for Krusty?
Well, kinda... But more universal. And maybe lose the me sooo solly bit.	Hey, whoa, whoa. Lets not tamper with a classic.
Shut up, kid. Come on, Leno. Tamper. Teach. Impart.	Dad!
Well, they are. So make with the loofah or get out.	... And then, of course, theres Mom, who sounds something like this.
... And then, of course, theres Mom, who sounds something like this.	Eat your vegetables. Take a sweater. I dont think thats a good idea.
From now on, Im gonna be just like Krusty and tell it like it is. Marge, youre gettin a little fat around the old thighs.	Dad!
I knew I shoulda gone on first.	I dont get it, Krusty. You said you would never be a shill again.
Cmon, Ill give you a ride home.	Wow, this is roomy!
Hey, I thought your mother told you to take a bath.	Yeah, Mom says a lot of things.
No, you look a little nervous, Lisa.	Youre up to something, arent you?
Thats my girl. You just go home, and dont worry your pretty blue head about it. Moe will take care of everything.	Well, Dad, in the meantime, heres a carton of smokes you can use to buy stuff.
Aw, thanks, boy. Ill give you two packs for that candy bar.	Three.
Why you little...	Guard! Guard!
Comin right up.	Hey, theres a balloon machine in the bathroom!
Ugh, Salisbury soup again!	My Joe isnt sloppy enough!
Ill take that.	What are they doing with our forty-five cents?
Excellent, Milhouse!	How bout this?
Room for one more...	Were watching the TV.
Man has always loved his buildings. But what happens when the buildings say No more?	Yes! Heh, heh! / Ha! Ha! / Woo hoo hoo heh heh! / Woo! / Oh! Oh!
Yes! Heh, heh! / Ha! Ha! / Woo hoo hoo heh heh! / Woo! / Oh! Oh!	Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! / Ha! Ha! All right!
Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! / Ha! Ha! All right!	Ha! Ha! Ha! Hee! Hee!/ Woo hoo! Ha! Ha! / I didnt think it was gonna fall over. Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha! Hee! Hee!/ Woo hoo! Ha! Ha! / I didnt think it was gonna fall over. Ha! Ha!	Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! / Woo! Woo! Woo!
Yeah! Ha! Ha! Ha! / Woo! Woo! Woo!	The best part was when the buildings fell down!
If she started dinner three minutes earlier, we wouldnt be in this mess!	Relax, Lis. Dad and I always have a Plan B.
But those candy bars are all squished and melted.	Whuh?
No!!	No what?
Bart!	What? Oh, napkin, right.
Well tape it!	Why is she saying all this? Is she dying?
Thanks. I play a millionaire at parties. At least, Id like to.	You probably shouldve researched this first, eh, Dad?
Unless youre a man.	So, wait a minute. This means Im gonna be a failure?
Yes, son. A spectacular failure.	Enh.
We have a very special visitor today. But hes no ordinary visitor. In fact, uh, you might say...	Hes a robot. We saw him on the way in.
What a whimsical building! Who says science cant be fun?	Me. I smell a museum.
...And the floor was donated by American Superball.	Hey, Im gonna go toss the virtual salad!
Stop that! Youre hurting it!	So hows it supposed to work?
Well--	Bo-ring. Am I on the Internet?
No. You can only access the...	Bo-ring. Whats that fire for?
Whoa-ho! This whole planet like is one big skate park!	Look out, Ralph!
I found a moon rock in my nose.	Houston, we have a booger.
Tell it to the ear, baby.	Good one, guys.
Simpson, go kiss the virtual ass.	Yes, sir.
You know whos nice?	No, who?
That Ralph Wiggum boy. Hes a real winner.	You would know.
Bart, you dont have to go anywhere today. Ive got a surprise for you.	Whuh?
I scheduled a play date.	A what? With who?
Hi, Bart. Were gonna be friends! I have a finger trap.	Whoa! Get him off! Get him off!
Fighting only makes it tighter.	You want me to hang out with Ralph Wiggum?
Not hang out. Play date!	Stop sayin that!
Now, why dont you show off your new friend around the neighborhood? You two make an adorable pair.	Someone will be right with you.
Someone will be right with you.	Mom, school has changed a lot since you were a kid. Popularity is very important now.
But...	Dont talk. Listen. The social order of elementary school is densely layered. The coolest kids are at the top.
Oh, you mean like the A students?	Mom, I dont want to play with Ralph.
Hes just a misunderstood little boy who needs a friend. And, if he hangs around with you, well, everyone will think hes cool.	Uh-huh...
Uh-huh...	Well, I dont know about that... It might help him a little...
Okay, great. You kids have fun.	Hey, wait! I, I didnt agree to...
Hey, wait! I, I didnt agree to...	Mom, I am not...
Your toys are fun to touch. Mine are all sticky.	Ralph, I just got through sorting those.
I dropped my popstickle in your toy chest.	Ralph, would you just --
Look, a rocket ship!	Thats not a toy. Hey... Do you know how to play hide and seek?
Shh. Ive been here two hours. And Bart still hasnt finded me.	These syrup stains are the worst.
Bart, its too nice a day to leave Ralph in a closet. You boys should go play outside.	But people will see me paired up with a doofus. You have no idea what thats like.
Uh-oh.	Im going.
Slow down, Bart. My legs dont know how to be as long as yours.	Well that is your problem, Ralph. This is how I always walk.
Videotaping this crime spree is the best idea we ever had.	Quick, Ralph. In the bushes.
Quick, Ralph. In the bushes.	Hi, guys. Hot enough for ya?
Shut up.	That was too close. We gotta stay off the streets.
This is my swing set. This is my sandbox. Im not allowed to go in the deep end. Thats where I saw the leprechaun.	Right, leprechaun.
You wanna play stuffed animal parade?	Maybe later. Come on, Ralph -- your Dads a cop. There must be some cool stuff around here. Bullets, dead body photos, what have you.
He keeps that stuff in his closet, but he says Im not allowed in there.	Did he say Im not allowed in there?
Yes.	Well, Im going in anyway.
Well, Im going in anyway.	Oh Lord, I thank you for this bounty Im about to receive...
Oh Lord, I thank you for this bounty Im about to receive...	Hmmm. Wow! Dads been in jail six times. Aw, and Moms only been in twice.
Hello, Sarah? Ralphie? Its me, Chief Wiggum.	We better hide.
We better hide.	Quick, in here!
You know youre not supposed to go in there. What is your fascination with my forbidden closet of mystery?	Sorry, Chief. Uhm, we were just playing.
Ah, that takes me back to the sixties.	Whats that weird key for?
Thats Daddys magic key. It opens every door in town.	The police master key.
The police master key.	Oh, Ralph, do you realize what we can do with... Get me a towel.
Do the message! Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da. Da, da, da, dada, dada, da, da.	So long -- Im gonna sleep over at Ralphs.
Oh, see, I knew youd find something you liked about him.	Ohh, I found something all right.
Uh, Ralphs a little afraid of the dark, Bart. Is it okay to sleep with a night-light?	Absolutely.
Toy store! Toy store! Toy store! Weee!	Ahh, to be eight again...
I cant believe we ate a whole wedding cake.	And an entire pan of funeral fudge.
Ha! Ha! / Isnt that adorable? / The girls are on a play date. / Precious.	Uh, Ill take it from here, Ralph. Umm, were just hangin, chillin... little bit of illin.
Which makes you a lamewad.	Oh, yeah? Would a lamewad have the police master key?
Hey, maybe you are cool enough to hang out with us.	Really? You think so? I dont know what to say. This is all happening so fast.
Lets use it to key some cars.	Those are all moderately cool ideas, but if you really want to walk on the wild side, I know just the place.
Im scared, Bart. I wanna go home.	Cmon, Ralph. Dont embarrass me. Its just an abandoned prison. All the murderers are long dead... and Im sure their ghosts are probably in hell.
My key...	Sorry, Ralph.
Wait, I missed that. Get him to say it again.	Go on home, Ralph.
I cant without Daddys key.	I cant bail on a friend, even if it is Ralph.
Aw, you wuss.	Hey, give it back!
Hey, keep away.	Hey, come on! I thought we were friends.
Daddys key went in there!	Hey, Ralph. Youre braver than you thought.
Hey, Ralph. Youre braver than you thought.	Wait for me!
The pointy kitty took it.	Danger, eh?
Smells like hot dogs.	Hmm, maybe it still works. Gimme the newlyweds from that cake.
Hmm, maybe it still works. Gimme the newlyweds from that cake.	Stand back!
Stand back!	What a gyp.
Maybe our key fits in here.	Till death do you part...
Somebody down there?	Uh-oh, lets get out of here.
Go fish!	Oh. See, heres the problem, Ralph. You have several threes.
Go fish!	Why dont we watch cartoons? The Justice League is moving into their new building today.
To demonstrate what youre in for, I will now strap myself into this electric chair, which was deactivated over thirty years ago, and I can only assume still is.	Uh-oh. We didnt reset the safety switch.
Hes gonna smell like hot dogs!	Operator, get me Morningwood Penitentiary. Its an emergency.
Come on! A mans life is at stake! We need to get a message to the prison!	Think! Think!
Lisas a good thinker.	Thats it! Ralph, youre a genius!
Theyre getting ready to throw the switch!	Come on, Lisa! Hurry!
Ralph? But the rocket was my idea.	But asking you was Ralphs idea.
But surely, I deserve some credit for...	Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!
Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!	Aw, let him have this one, Lis. After all, its Ralph.
Aw, thats sweet, honey. Ill bring you back a hat.	Hey, Homer, bring me back a torpedo.
No.	But Flanders got his kids torpedoes.
Hey, Bart, check out my new earring! Pretty cool, huh?	Milhouse, my mom wears earrings -- do you think shes cool?
Milhouse! Milhouse! Milhouse!	Hey, if you want cool, check this out. EVERYBODY IF YOU CAN DO THE BARTMAN! SHAKE YOUR BODY TURN IT OUT IF YOU CAN CAN DO THE BARTMAN YEAH!
Can I help you?	Id like to get my ear pierced.
What on earth possessed you to get an earring?	Milhouse has one.
If Milhouse jumped off a cliff--	Milhouse jumped off a cliff? Im there!
Youre a disgrace to this family and its proud Naval tradition!	Well, Im keeping this earring and you cant stop me!
Well, I guess thats everyone. Except earring-boy.	Come on, Dad. Didnt you ever do anything wild when you were a kid?
Well, when I was ten I got my ear pierced but this is completely different!	Fine. Take it.
Boy, I guess I was wrong about that earring. It saved us all.	Then can I get a tattoo that says, Bite Me? You never know when it might come in handy.
I dont think so, son.	A king cobra?
No.	Weapons-grade plutonium?
Ask your mother.	Knock-out drops?
No.	Ninja death stars?
Okay, Marge, if anyone asks, you require 24-hour nursing care, Lisas a clergyman, Maggie is seven people and Bart was wounded in Vietnam...	Cool!
Quiet, honey, you dont know how big this government is. It goes all the way to the president.	There you go, Ratboy.
Okay, kids, I want some answers. Where do you think your father would go with a trillion dollars?	My Dad has a trillion dollars? Wow! I can buy and sell your sorry ass. Ill give you a billion dollars to empty the cat box for me.
Ach, shes a bonnie pile. Now for a wee nip and a wee nap.	Ready, Milhouse?
Ach! Me pile! Its been raped of its bonnieness!	Hi, Willie.
Hi, Willie.	My board!
You did this, Bart Simpson!	The man knows quality work.
This time youre in for it, Bart.	Whats he gonna do?
Oh, honey, Im so proud of you. All your hard work and grade grubbing have finally paid off!	So whos on your news team? Nerd, nerd... Nelson?!
Well, we used to date. Plus, he threatened me.	Well, dont worry about sports. I got that covered.
Back off, Bart. This may be the only chance I get as a second grader to produce my own TV show, and Im not gonna let you screw it up.	Mo-om...
Come on, quit foolin around, you guys.	So we meet again, Mr. Bond.
Bart, get out of my anchor chair.	Silence, Octopussy.
And now, sports.	Bart Simpson telling you to lock the doggy in the barn cause here comes dodgeball action!
Bart Simpson telling you to lock the doggy in the barn cause here comes dodgeball action!	The shirts continued their domination over the skins today. And in schoolyard fights...the highly anticipated match between Kearney and Mr. Largo ended in a disqualification, for use of dog doo on a stick. Lisa?
All right, kids, we learned a lot today. Now, this is what makes my job difficult. Bart, youre off the sports beat.	What?!
What?!	Oooh, thats gotta hurt!
In English, Lisa.	Damn blueberry stains.
This filthy monkey made the orange juice youre drinking.	Ill show Lisa whos dumb. Supreme Court reverses... I wont turn to the comics, I wont turn to the comics.
Ill show Lisa whos dumb. Supreme Court reverses... I wont turn to the comics, I wont turn to the comics.	All right, Ill read one comic just to get me rollin. Archie. Hey, Jughead, didja hear, the Supreme Court reversed...
All right, Ill read one comic just to get me rollin. Archie. Hey, Jughead, didja hear, the Supreme Court reversed...	Mom, am I dumb?
Well bring you more on this chalk shortage as it continues. And now, Barts been looking into that alleged ham salad from yesterdays school lunch.	No, I havent, Lisa. Because I went out with a camera and did a different kind of story.
Bart, I really think we should stick--	Its about a man. A simple man. Hes one of... Barts People.
Its about a man. A simple man. Hes one of... Barts People.	Joe Banks, 82 years young, has come to this pond every day for the past 17 years to feed the ducks. But last month, Joe made a discovery. The ducks were gone.
Joe Banks, 82 years young, has come to this pond every day for the past 17 years to feed the ducks. But last month, Joe made a discovery. The ducks were gone.	Some say the ducks went to Canada. Others say Toronto. And some people think that Joe used to sit down there... near those ducks. But it could be that theres just no room in this modern world for an old man and his ducks.
No!	One man. No ducks. Lisa?
That wasnt news. That was sappy manipulative drivel.	Well, Im sorry you couldnt feel for old Joe.
Oh, I dont need your pity.	Our forgotten veterans. Their guns are quiet now. Their helmets lost, or pawned. And yet here they are, making flags out of old clothes. Sure, they may not have the right number of stripes, and the colors are all wrong, and some purists will tell you the American flag doesnt contain the word, Jordache. But you know, if they run this up the flagpole, Ill salute. Im Bart Simpson.
Hmm, thank you, Bart, for yet another touching Barts People. Now, turning to--	I just think our veterans deserve a little recognition.
Thats what Veterans Day is for, Bart.	But is that really enough to honor our brave soldiers?
They also have Memorial Day.	Oh, Lisa, maybe youre right. Maybe youre wrong. The important thing is Veterans deserve a day to honor them.
They have two.	Well, maybe they should have three. Im Bart Simpson.
Oh my, look at all these letters from people who want to be Barts People, Bart.	I wish they could all be Barts People, Mom. I truly do.
Im proud of you, honey. Youre finally giving something back to the community, after taking so, so much.	Hmm. It really makes you think.
What does that even mean? Mom might not see through you, but I do. You dont care about any of these people.	Well, if Im guilty of anything, maybe its caring too much. Im Bart Simpson.
Hey, heres another letter for Barts People.	Oh, so many souls, so little air time.
Oh, so many souls, so little air time.	Dear Bart, I came to this country, hoping to share the American dream. But after many years of back-breaking labor, I find myself homeless and sleeping in a junkyard.
Oh-how-terrible-read-on.	Should I abandon hope or fight on bravely against impossible odds? Oh, this is too perfect.
It is, isnt it?	Im gonna put him on the air tonight, live.
Oh, Bart, youll have to ride your bike pretty fast to get out there in time...	Naw, Ill just take the chopper.
Eww. Thank you, Milhouse. Now its time for todays special live edition of Barts People.	Lisa, Ive just arrived at the Springfield dump. A lot of things get thrown out here. Sometimes, even a human being. Somewhere in this pile of twisted metal and soiled mattresses...
Yeah! By yew!	Groundskeeper Willie! Uhm. Ah. So, so youre the immigrant Im here to help.
Help?! You destroyed mY house and reduced me to living in a dump .	Groundskeeper Willie, furious with the government that let him down. Im Bart Simp--
Oh, Bart, its me, a jolly policeman. Oh, we got Willie. Come on out so we can give you a medal.	Way to go, officer!
Way to go, officer!	GAAAH!
Ah! Youre right, its all Willies fault. Ive been a terrible father.	Hey, Lis. Thanks.
Boy, that phony schmaltz of yours sure is powerful stuff.	Uh, yeah, but I have a certain respect for that whole truth and hard work thing that you do.
You know, Bart, if we combined your showmanship with my integrity, we could make kids really care about the news.	Youre right. If we work together, theres no stopping us.
I cant believe they cancelled us for this stupid...	Shut up! Im trying to watch this.
I guess.	What the hell is this?
Kiss it.	Uh, maybe later.
Its full, Dad. That means you have to take out the trash.	Yep, thats the rule. He who tops it off, drops it off.
So long, chicken bone.	See you in hell, brussel sprouts.
No room for you, Jell-O.	Goodbye, fine China.
Yeah, but Im always secretly disappointed when you do. Anyway, I think those garbage men are starting to crack.	I think youre startin to crack.
Apologize for that remark.	No way.
Okay, before I show ya, who wants to guess how I got the money?	Dealing drugs?
Thats awful! I almost wish it were drugs.	Some of it is.
Thats what I call break-neck speed.	Mom, a man just died.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Bart! Bart! Over here! O-over here!	Um... Ill take... Nelson.
Saving the best for last, huh, Bart?	Yeah, that must be it.
Oh, play the damn game, Ned.	Yeah, well, if you get a grown-up, then so do we. I pick my Dad.
Yeah, well, if you get a grown-up, then so do we. I pick my Dad.	Oh, youd be surprised. He gets pretty competitive when hes drinking. Cmon, Dad. Were playing Capture the Flag!
Sorry, son, Daddys down for the day. Why dont you go capture me some more potato salad?	But Rod picked his Dad. Its a matter of family honor.
Oh, it appears I will have to find a new Fortress of Solitude.	Okay, Dad, theyve got our flag guarded pretty good...
I agree. Lets surrender.	No, wait. I have a plan. But Ill need your underpants.
This isnt the flag! It looks more like... Ewww!	Suckers! Go Dad!
Suckers! Go Dad!	Come on, Dad! Just a few more feet! Show em what you got!
Dad, what have you done to your stomach?	And your chest!
Homer, please remember to wipe your sweat off that machine. I got a terrible rash yesterday.	You know Rainier Wolfcastle?
Not for all the applesauce in Glueckenschlaben.	My Dad could do it!
My Dad could do it!	He eats fifty dollars worth of Power Sauce bars a day.
Aww. Goodbye, everyone. Dont touch my stuff.	Dad, wait. Youre not risking your life just to impress me, are you?
Well, yeah...	Oh, cool! Now get goin, chop-chop!
Oh, man, this is hard.	Uh, Dad?
Uh, Dad?	Shouldnt you save a couple bottles for when youre a little higher?
Uh, Im pretty sure hes dead, little girl. Here, have a Power Sauce bar. Its on the house.	Hey! Somethings coming down the mountain! Fast!
Okay, heres what I think happened...	Didja make it to the top, Dad? Huh? Didja?
Why dont you tell me, son? See any interesting flags up there?	All I see is a pole. Maybe the flag fell off.
Aw, dammit!	Forget about it, Homer. You made it to the top. Youre the coolest Dad ever.
Hey Bart, whats your favorite thing about teachers conference day?	Hm. I guess that we dont have to go to school.
Wow, mine too!	The world is completely different on a weekday morning. Banks are open, old people are walking the streets with impunity...
The world is completely different on a weekday morning. Banks are open, old people are walking the streets with impunity...	And look! Barneys not even drunk yet!
Ill take three pairs! Heres my prescription.	Hmm...
Hey. You wanna not play with that? Just got it charged.	Maybe you can help me. I dont think my face is as hilarious as it could be. What can you show me in a nose or forehead accessory?
WWWhoa! Looking sharp.	Well. Thanks, guvnor.
If you put dog doo on the suction cups, theyll stick better.	Milhouse, Im not gonna take dog doo thats been on the dirty ground and put it on my face. I have a better idea.
Oh, I cant wait! In just twenty minutes, well be in a three hour line to see the Orb of Isis.	Ta-da!
Ta-da!	Notice anything new?
Bart! What have I told you about throwing money away at that joke shop?	To try and cut back a little?
Take those silly things off.	It wont come off.
Bart, did you glue those on?	Oh, dont be ridiculous.
In case of accidental ingestion, consult a mortician. Oh my goodness!	Mom, I didnt eat any of it. Im not stupid.
Weve got to get you to a doctor right away.	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
But its the last day of the Isis exhibit!	Well, you should have thought of that before I glued all this stuff to my face.
Oh, didnt I? Nothing dissolves glue better than human sweat. I knew Bart would panic and start perspiring at the sight of this button applicator.	Couldnt you have just turned up the heat a little?
Lisa, were home! Sorry about the museum! Youd better go up and apologize.	But my apologies always sound so forced.
Do it!	Hey, Lis. Im sorry I ruined your Egyptian thing. Were still buds, right?
Stop it, Lisa!	That shut her up.
Playin Hot Wheels.	Ow! That had a guide pin in it.
But Marge, the Gilded Truffle is an intimate, elegant place.	Bo-ring. Ill take you to a place thats really romantic.
... And thats why today, bananas are called yellow fatty beans. Questions?	When are Mom and Dad coming back?
Bored, are ya? Lisa, go cut me a switch.	Oh, theres gotta be something to do around here. Hey, are they pulling the plug on anybody today?
And thats how I earned the Iron Cross.	Can we borrow this, Grampa?
Hey, public display.	Yeah, whats with the love thang?
What are we looking for, anyway?	Pirate booty. What else?
Arr, well dig up the treasure in seven yar. Ive drawn a map on this cracker, which Polly will hold for safe keepin.	So you see, theres treasure everywhere.
Its a bottle cap.	Jewel-encrusted?
But its all trash.	Exactly. Now theres nothing left out there but treasure.
Hello, everybody.	Hey, youre back. Did you rock the Casbah?
Wow! An alternate ending to Casablanca! Bart, this could be priceless!	Priceless like a mothers love, or the good kind of priceless?
Unbelievable.	Ill say. Wasnt it great? And the question mark leaves the door open for a sequel.
Ah, my studio produced Casablanca, all right. We tried to tack that happy ending on the picture cause back then, well, studio execs we were, we were just dopes in suits. Not like today.	What are you talking about? I loved it.
Oh, it would have to be Camera Day.	Wowww.
Uh, I was just trying to find Dave Barrys column.	Hes great! He pokes fun at lifes little foibles.
All youre getting is rubber bands and paper clips? Dont you need a notebook or something?	Nah. These days everythings done on computers.
Nah. These days everythings done on computers.	And staplers. Computers and staplers.
And now for the profit taking.	Uh, Dad, I dont think the dog can handle any more bacon.
Where do you think youre goin?	Its the first day of school.
Woo hoo!	Dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars.
Yeah, but your Mom paid for that.	But doesnt she get her money from you?
Wow, look at that load of grease. Boy, if were ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation.	Um, I dont know how much more school I can miss.
Im sure they didnt ditch you, honey. Maybe they went off to plan a surprise party for you.	Oh, yeah. Good one, Mom.
Oh Ill say. Look at that redheaded kid. There must be twenty dollars worth of grease on his forehead alone.	I was thinking more of the deep fryer.
Mr. Maruca ? Help!	Moms gonna kill you.
Emus? Really? Oh, thats pretty crazy... Nah... Id only fail just like I fail at everything.	Hey, Dad, Ive been thinking. What if instead of giving up on grease, we go for one last big score?
Dear Lord, I know youre busy, seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that. But if you help us steal this grease tonight, I promise well donate half the profits to charity.	Dad, hes not stupid.
This better work, boy. I dont wanna wind up workin on your mothers emu farm.	Dont worry. This is the score weve been dreamin about. The grease traps in this kitchen have never been emptied.
What is it?	Uh, nothing.
Ah, its gonna be a long night.	Wheres the hose?
Bringin up the rear.	Are you as excited as I am?
And now we wait. So... is this your school?	Well, it used to be.
Oh. I see youre having a party. Ill come back later.	You cant come back later because...
Oh, all right. Maybe I can pinpoint where my life went wrong.	Quiet, Dad, or well have to throw you outta here.
All we did was grow some space tomatoes and sabotage Mir.	Remember when you almost became heavyweight champ?
Oh, I shoulda punted. Turn it off! Turn it off!	Hang on, Dad, this next partll definitely make you feel better about yourself.
It was Thomas Edison, Dad.	I thought he invented the light bulb.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!	Top of the world, ma!
De de de de de.	Thats great, Dad.
And these Hardy Boys books are great, too. This one is about smugglers.	Theyre all about smugglers.
Yes. Thomas Edison smoked several cigars a day.	Yeah. He invented stuff, too.
Okay. Umm... automatic...	Butt.
Fluorescent...	Booger.
Lazy father...	Cant even spank his own kids...
Probably needs to be more powerful.	I will buy ten of those right now.
Sure! Believe me, every man in America will want to have one.	Gangway! Gotta poop.
Really? You think its a good idea?	Oh yeah, safety sells. Especially to lame-os.
AWDAMMIT!	Hey, Dad, heard you swearing. Mind if I join in? Crap. Boobs. Crap.
I thought I had a great idea, but I mustve seen it on this poster.	If Edison thought of that chair, how come its not on this chart?
That chair might be the only one he made.	So?
So, weve got to go to the Edison Museum and smash it! Then Ill be an inventor!	But I thought you loved Edison.
Aw, to hell with him!	Yeah! Hell, damn, fart!
Outta the way. This is one invention youre not getting credit for, you inspiration hog!	Your electric hammer, maestro?
Look, son. Edison was just like me.	You mean the wild mood swings?
Were not rivals. Were just a couple of dreamers who set the bar a little too high. I cant destroy your work, my friend.	Can I?
No, but well stop off at the da Vinci Museum on the way home...	Uh, I think thats in Italy, Dad.
Dad, those should be your millions.	I gotta admit, Homer. Youre taking this pretty well.
Well, thats it.	One stinkin letter? Whyd you make us gather round like that?
Mom, they put every kid in America in that book, just so gullible parents will buy it. Its all a big scam.	Shut up.
Are you sure? I can usually smell a scam from two towns over.	Yeah, Lis. She is a smart, sophisticated woman. Now lets hear more about that big, big reward.
Look at me, Bart! Im driving!	Were all proud of you, Dad.
Hang in there, Dad! Just half a basket left!	Wow, you sure get a lot of balls for a quarter.
Hey, thats cheating.	Okay, what can I get for twelve, count em, twelve prize tickets?
Hmm, hot food is tempting... but I just cant say no to a weapon.	Whoa, can I try that some time?
Yeah, sure. Never hurts to have a second set of prints on a gun.	Wow, thanks, Nelson! Ill come by your house later --
You stay away from Nelson Muntz.	But, Mom --
Nelsons a troubled, lonely, sad little boy. He needs to be isolated from everyone.	But, Mom --
Yes?	Thats all I got.
So what prize did you end up getting?	Mustache comb. Whatd you get?
Wanna comb it?	This sucks. Its time to punch outta this yawn factory. Im going to Nelsons.
But Mom said not to!	She doesnt scare me. I do what I want, when I want. Oh God, inchworms!
Nah, my Moms got bigger problems. She doesnt give a crap what I do.	Wow, you are so lucky.
Youre not going out without a scarf, are ya?	Eh, I dont need one.
Think I can hit that bottle?	Yeah, probably.
Thats my Dads shootin car. Just three more payments, and its ours.	Oh, cool. Can I get a shot now?
Hang on. First, how bout I try and peg you in the stomach?	Mmm. No, thanks.
Or what about you put on these nerd glasses and I shoot em off?	No way. Cmon, quit hoggin the gun.
Bet you cant hit that bird from here.	Are you crazy? I dont wanna shoot a stupid bird.
Thats cuz you know you cant. Youre not a superstud like me.	Am too.
Are not. Youre an octo-wussy. Ohh, look at me. Im Bart Simpson. Im scared to use a gun. I want to marry Milhouse. I walk around like this. La la la la la la la...	Hey, quit it!
Hey, quit it!	Oh my God...
Whoa-oa, major shot! You even compensated for the crooked sight!	Crooked sight?
You are one cold-blooded killer, dude!	But, but I wasnt... I didnt...
Should we bury it, or chuck it into a car full of girls?	Hey, leave it alone.
Okay, okay. Dont kill me, killer.	Dont call me that!
Bart Simpson, do you know why youve been summoned before this tribunal?	Yes, sir. Because I killed an innocent bird.
But since youve confessed to bird-slaughter, we have no choice but to peck your face off!	No! Not the face!
I got bored, so I started slapping you.	Uh-oh.
Killer? Why did he call you killer?	Mom, you were right. Nelson is bad news. Can we go home?
What are you hiding there?	Nothing.
What are those cats doing behind you?	Uh, cats like me.
Uh, cats like me.	Get off, get off!
Bart! Did you kill that poor bird?	I didnt mean to, Mom. The gun pulled to the left --
You disobeyed me, snuck over here, and murdered a helpless animal?	I know, I really screwed up. I deserve to be punished.
Whats the point, Bart? I punish and I punish and I punish, but it never sinks in. So you know what? Do what you want. You want to play with little hoodlums? Fine. Have fun killing things.	Mom, wait...
Mom, wait...	Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.	Hi, little eggs. Im not sure how to tell you this, but... Y-Your mom was involved in an incident. Mistakes were made. By me. But dont worry, Ill take care of you.
Check it out, guys. Ive been working on this regurgitation thing.	Oh, yeah. Hope you like PopTarts.
Oh, yeah. Hope you like PopTarts.	I think Ill call you Chirpy Boy, and you Bart Junior. And you can call me Mother. No, wait, that sounds kinda fruity. Just call me Mom.
Oh, no!	Ive gotta keep these warm.
Bart, stop whatever youre doing and come down here.	Cant right now. Come back later.
Hows this for later?!	Mom, listen--
Eggs?	That bird I killed was their mother. I dont want her babies to die, too.
Sure it didnt.	Is the nest still warm enough, Mom?
I see an eye!	I see a neck!
Dad, they arent birds.	Sure they are. They came from eggs in a birds nest. Therefore, theyre birds. Ixo fatso.
One, they dont have beaks, two, they dont have feathers, and three, theyre lizards.	Youre a lizard.
Hmmm. My God, a pigeon! Thats the last bird on my list! Huh. So long, suckers.	Excuse me. Can you tell us what kind of birds these are? They hatched from eggs I found in a nest.
Ill just get those killed and you can be on your way.	Wait! What the heck are you doing?!
What a chump.	Help! Dads trying to kill me!
Look, Skinner, we havent got all day. Kill the horrid beasts, then do away with their lizards.	No! Dont hurt them! Ill just keep them as pets.
No, they might escape and breed. The law is very clear on this they must be exterminated as quickly and as gruesomely as possible.	Nooo! Theyre mine.
Bart, Im sorry, but theres nothing we can do. Your lizards are banned by federal law.	Everyone thinks theyre monsters, but I raised them and I love them. I know thats hard to understand.
Run for it.	Really?
Stupid cards.	Guys, is it really true? Are you cold-blooded egg-murderers?
Guys, is it really true? Are you cold-blooded egg-murderers?	Dont use that look on me. I invented that look.
Whoa, look at em.	Go, Chirpy Boy! Go, Bart Junior!
I dont get it, Bart. You got all upset when you killed one bird, but now youve killed tens of thousands and it doesnt bother you at all.	Hey, youre right. I call the front seat!
Oh, you are soooo dead, little dude.	Thanks a lot, Chief.
Worlds Deadliest Executions! Making his first appearance on our show, heaaarrrs... Snake!	Phew, that was close.
Who wants to see their sexy new daddy?	Whoa!
Its hammer time, Snitchy.	Thats Snakes voice!
Oh, my God!	Oh, man!
I told you capital punishment isnt a deterrent.	Dont you get it? He swore hed kill me too. Im next!
There. Now no murderers can get in... or out.	Dad?
You are sooo dead.	Nooo!
Oh please, Lisa. Everyones already figured that out.	Youve got to fight the hair, Dad!
I love you, son.	I love you too, Dad.
I love you too, Dad.	Get off of me.
Your blood! Okay, get ready for the violent-est, disemboweling-est, vomit inducing-est Itchy and Scratchy Halloween Special ever--!	What the--
Why dont you kids come trick-or-treating with Maggie and me?	Nah, its too early. I need to work under cover of darkness.
Mama took those batteries / She took em away / Mama took those batteries / Size double A...	Theres gotta be some batteries in here somewhere.
Theres gotta be some batteries in here somewhere.	Hmm...
Ohh, Bart, thats plutonium. Its highly unstable.	Dont you ever get tired of being wrong?
Whats wrong with the TV?	Colors screwed up.
Colors screwed up.	Whoaaa! Cool!
How humiliating.	Look!
Lets teach them a lesson.	A cartoon axe. I love it.
Were done for, Bart!	Not if I know cartoons!
Not if I know cartoons!	Not now Lis, Im trying to relax.
Oh, thats it, Im going home! Dom DeLuise can interview himself.	Itchys house. This is where we came in.
Huh? Oh, okay... Lets see... pause, three, no fa-fa...	Hurry, Homer!
Hurry, Homer!	Oooh, that is gonna hurt tomorrow.
Lisa, look out! A skeleton!	Oh!
Ohh... Ahh...	Oh, thats disgusting.
But nothing. Get your slimeless hands off her.	People, people. Space monsters. This is going nowhere. Theres only one man who can settle an argument this bizarre.
No, that would make me a great father.	So are we going to the lake or what?
Well, it looks like the lake is the place to be, huh?	Well, if wed left at four A.M. like I wanted to...
Screw this. Hang on, everyone. Were takin the ol Simpson shortcut.	Whooa!
Well, way out in the sticks like this, it could only be hillbillies.	So, I suppose thats a hillbilly Jacuzzi?
Life jackets?	Check.
Here we go!	Shes down.
Hows he doing?	I dont know... I think Dad might be a little heavy for parasailing.
Higher, I say! I want to soar higher than any man has ever soared! I want to look down on the clouds with contempt! I want to sneer at Gods creation and spit on his -- uh-oh.	There goes my turn.
Homie, are you okay?	Weve been looking all over for you, Dad. Where did you land?
When Kim makes a Manwhich, she uses foccacia bread. And would it kill you to put some fennel in it?	Alec Baldwin, wow. That is the coolest person youve ever been fired by. What was it like at their house?
Well, there were script problems from day one.	Didnt seem like anybody even read the script.
I didnt choose to be a gifted actor, Marge. It chose me. Im merely a vessel through which genius flows. Now help me make up some phony credits.	Fat Guy Number Three?
Hey, Dad, it says they need your full name. You only put down your middle initial.	Hey, what the heck is your middle name, anyway?
Serves her right fer bein a sixties radical. Though she was a demon in the sack.	Uh, so, Dad, regarding that form... why not just make up a middle name?
No way, narc. Bodily functions are a natural thing.	Not to mention hilarious.
Uh-oh. I dont like the sound of that.	Oh, please God, dont let them come in here.
Perhaps in time.	Aw, cheer up, Dad. You make a great hippie.
Aww, youre just saying that.	No, really. Youre lazy and self-righteous...
Yes, he was lucky. If that had been a gladiola, hed be dead right now.	Well, why dont you just pull it out?
Yes. Just like it was last week.	If youre gonna get snippy, Ill take my business elsewhere.
Im way ahead of you.	Dad! The fish!
No, no, you just stay put.	Wow, you didnt even feel her forehead. How do I get that kind of credibility?
With eight years of scrupulous honesty.	Meh, its not worth it.
I need a miracle. Come on, you owe me.	Sup, sis?
Bart?! Shouldnt you be in class?	I am.
I am.	Its a little something I whipped up in shop. Mostly latex. Whatre you doing out here?
Weve got a test, and I didnt read the book. Ill get a zero for sure, Bart! What do I do?	Well, if it was me, Id just take the zero. Ah, but, thats not for everyone. Theres one other possibility.
Hey, I cant go in there!	Relax, theres nothing here you didnt see when Dad boycotted pants.
Teacher and subject?	Miss Hoover, Wind in the Willows.
Steamed Maine cabbages!	Pardon me for asking, but where the hells my stupid lobster?
Pinchy, I made you some risotto.	What? You gotta be kiddin me.
Cant you see the difference between earning something honestly and getting it by fraud?	Hmmm... I suppose maybe if, uh... no. No, sorry, thought I had it there for a sec.
The highest grade.	Okay, Lisas gone!
Sorry, Marge. Pinchy got all dirty in the yard chasing birds. But dont worry. I put him in a nice hot bath.	Hey, what smells so good?
Oh, man, thats good. Pass the butter.	Are you gonna eat that all by yourself?
Hip hip--	We heard you the first time.
Im done.	Wow! Have you ever seen so many robot cowboys?
Lets see. One, two, three... six whiskeys!	All right!
Look whos a little cowgirl!	Hey, Mom, look what I got.
Oh, thats cute. Did you get it in the souvenir shop?	No, that security guard is handing them out.
Uh, should we help him?	He knows what hes doing.
Well now thats what I always thought, but somehow...	Check it out, Dad. I rented all your favorite gorilla movies. Gorilla Squadron, Gorilla Island VI,...
I cant imagine Dad running away like this. Leaving his father to die.	Even I wouldnt do that. And Im Americas Bad Boy.
Hmmm...	Dad, youre tickling me.
Well, beats work.	Yup, beats school.
This is one small step towards firing your ass.	Hey, wait. I saw that Lost in Space movie. You are not Doctor Smith.
Oh, poor Mark Hamill.	That swarm of nerds is gonna kill him!
Oh, how was I supposed to know its not a real spaceship?	Dad, over here!
Hold it! Whats your clearance?	We just want to get a snack.
Access denied.	But, Da--
Mayor Quimby?! Homer, why didnt you say you was with the mayor?	Well, then you start it.
... And after Moes, we went to Krustyburger and the mayor got some more change, and I ordered a double double, but they gave me the double double double double. And then Apu gave the Mayor lots of change for...	Dad, dont you see whats going on?
Bart, no!	Hey, my milk! I traded my math book for that!
Five... four... three...two..	All right! Here comes the implosion!
Ive never heard of these bands, Mom. What kind of music do they play?	Crap rock?
Ten dollars?! What is this, a car wash for millionaires?	Throw hot wax on him, Dad!
You mean that one with the red paint?	Youve never snuck out of church to break into cars?
Especially me.	But youve gotta support the team, Dad. Theyre already threatening to move to Moose Jaw.
And, whats this? Hes pointing to the right field bleachers! Probably at a dying little boy.	Mom, am I dying?
So, who won? The losers?	No, they lost.
Hello, big Maggie.	Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!	Someone trashed the school!
The Bloodening.	The cops cant just slap a curfew on us. We have rights.
Well, if kids are so innocent, why is everything bad named after them? Acting childish. Kidnapping. Child abuse...	What about adultery?
What a beautiful night... fireflies, full moon...	And here we are, locked inside.
When was the last time you played Citizenship?	Energy Shortage.
Ooh, The Game of Lent.	Cant we just go to bed?
Adults blow.	Yeah. Just look at em over there...
Drinking their coffee...	Scratching their big butts...
Hey, there is one thing we could do.	Lis! No! Its prime-time!
Dont Go There will be right back.	Oh no, it wont.
Forty years ago, a film appeared that was so shocking, so terrifying it was sealed in a concrete vault deep beneath the earth. But even the new management of Sony/Tri-star could not contain the pure evil of... The Bloodening.	Milhouse, do you see whats on Channel six?
Now playing at the Springfield Drive-In. After dark.	Milhouse, spread the word! Were seeing this movie -- tonight! Thats right, were breaking curfew!
Wait! We dont need supernatural powers! We already know their secrets.	Shes right! Homers done a ton of crap that never made the papers.
We gotta spread this stuff around. Lets put it on the Internet.	No! We have to reach people whose opinions actually matter. And I think I know how. Why dont we...
Well, turn something on. Im starting to think.	Good evening, adults.
Good evening, adults.	... we interrupt this broadcast to bring you a very special presentation. Tonights program is entitled...
Bo-ring. Go back to that infamy guy.	Constable Wiggum likes to act tough. But he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose?
I have a problem.	Tune in tomorrow, and every day until the curfew is lifted. Because well be revealing embarrassing secrets about Springfields other adults.
Well, at least theyve already done me.	And we have plenty more on Homer Simpson.
Speak for yourself! Bart, get down here! Im gonna spank you back to the Stone Age!	You cant make us come down.
WE OUGHTA DROWN YOU JUST LIKE CATS!	ADULTS! / YOU RUN OUR LIVES LIKE YOURE COLONEL KLINK.
Howdy, pardners. Welcome to your post office!	Wow, its ours?
Bart!!	Be with ya in a minute...
I got my letter to Santa.	A coupon book? What am I gonna do with this piece of junk?
I gotta hand it to you, Homer. Its really a good group.	Yeah. Not a dame in sight.
Go long, son.	Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!	Im catching a pass from Dan Marino! This is the greatest moment of my...
Okay, Moe. I believe you had me by the throat. Reverend Lovejoy was working the body...	Wait, Dad, look!
Gosh, fellas. To see yall stuck in here, when even guys in China can watch all the action from their town squares or what have you, well, I just feel pretty doggone bad. If they were electing a president of Dumbville, Id have to nominate me.	You got my vote.
Oh, way to go, Dolly.	Thank you.
Yeah.	Where is it, man?
You guys are following me? I was following Flanders.	Hey, look what I found!
Awwwww.	Dad, that doesnt belong to you.
Worse. The PoliceCops.	This isnt bad.
Homer, its just a coincidence, like that guy named Anthony Michael Hall who stole your car stereo.	Right. Coincidence.
The whole towns laughin at me. Even that cat out there. Bart, kill that cat!	Okay.
Let me down, Chief. Im begging you. Im a human being. Let me have my dignity back.	Now hes stupid and whiny.
Dynamic, isnt it?	I love it, Max.
And it doesnt stop in the bedroom. Oh no, Im taking charge. Kids, theres three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the Max Power way.	Isnt that the wrong way?
Sh-sh-sh. Anyway, the prince passed out for a hundred years, until he was awakened by the kiss of a noble raccoon...	And, thank you, God, for the bad things adults do, which distract attention from stuff Im doing. Amen.
Hes also thankful for your bounty, Lord.	Good save, Mom. Night.
Sweet dreams, honey.	Uh, Mom?
Uh, Mom?	Will you help me with my project? I need to make a working model of the digestive system.
Of course, honey.	Thanks! Its due tomorrow.
Tomorrow?! Well, thats too bad, mister. Im not gonna bail you out this time.	Youre right, Mom. I understand.
All right, Ill get you the materials. But youre building it.	Okay.
Annnd... now.	Wow, that looks great, Mom. Some of your best work.
Im solving world hunger.	Hey, youre wrecking it!
Eeeewwwwww!	I hope youre happy, Nelson.
Gimme that!	All right, the Personals! Hmm. Hm-hm-hm. Successful mayor-type seeks open-minded, discreet cheerleader-type.
Oh, thats sweet.	Oh, heres one, Desperately Seeking Suction--
TRY!	I didnt think it was physically possible, but this both sucks and blows.
YOU GIVE ME FEVER WHEN YOU TOUCH ME, FEVER WHEN YOU HOLD ME TIGHT FEVER -- HA!	Kill me.
I dont know... I, I hate to change lanes once I get going... thats really for race car drivers.	Mom, to your left. Hes letting you in. Go!
But Mom, I read that sport utility vehicles are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents.	Fatal to the people in the other car. Lets roll!
Hmm, I thought it was Sandy Duncan.	Uh-oh. Gridlock at twelve oclock.
Oh, crud. And were so close to the house.	Um, I dont want to alarm you, but the ice creams startin to go south.
Mom, Bart sprayed whipped cream in my eye!	I did not.
Kids, cut it out!	All right.
Hey!	Cmon, Mom, just cut across the field.
Oh, I dont know... It doesnt seem right.	Do you want to spend your whole life doing whats right?
Lets do it.	Whoooa! You the man, Mom!
Bart! Thats tomorrow nights dinner.	Youre tomorrow nights dinner.
Oh, Marge, you saved me!	Wow! You are so much cooler than Milhouses mom.
Why, this Stone Philips sounds like quite a bloke. What television network is he on?	Why, NBC, of course.
Okay, Bart, its your turn to pick. Where are we headed? Bowling? Demolition derby? P.J. OHarrigans? Isnt that a funny name? Huh? Huh?	Hysterical, but I traded my turn to Lisa for her dessert.
This is all your fault for trading away your turn. Just for that, no dessert tonight!	Trade you my next turn for your dessert.
Fonzies jacket!	Whos Fonzie?
How can they put a prop from a TV show next to the Bill of Rights?	So whats so great about the Bill of Rights?
Thats right, The Odd Couple. So meet your comically mismatched roommate, Bart Simpson.	Im gonna make your life a living hell.
Shut up.	You shut up.
Ugh, this is not gonna work.	No, you shut up.
Bart, stop it.	Stop what?
Squeaking that chair!	Hey, thats what I do in my room, Lis. I squeak my chair.
Hey, that looks like fun.	Race ya!
This sounds juicy.	Hmmm... Hey, Milhouse. Wanna have some fun?
Oh my God!	Oh, Mom, you are a pranksters dream. Wow, you really clobbered him!
That was a horrible trick to play on your mother!	Yeah, well, it serves you right for eavesdropping.
So I said to that nurse, You can take your free tetanus shot and shove it.	Well, you told her, Dad.
Lousy meat-eating scum.	Huh?
Well, maybe the animals dont mind, honey. They might enjoy being the center of attention.	I think I read somewhere that cows like being killed.
Ha, not likely.	Cool. Even this menu is made of meat. Its an entire chicken pounded flat.
Greenhorns! Whos a greenhorn? Whats a greenhorn?	Its an insult. Sock him, Dad. Sock everybody.
And on your right, Homer somebody!	Go Dad!
Yeah, cmon Homie!	Go! Go! Go!
Huh? Oh, right. The steak.	Come on, Dad, pick up the pace. Chew and swallow, no savoring.
So much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat...	Come on, Dad, just twelve more pounds.
Ive got to, honey. I owe it to ol Red, as both his friend and his killer.	Oh, lemme go with you, Dad!
Dont you have school?	Dont you have work?
Why you gotta... Come on! Ah! Now Im gettin the hang of this thing. I dont know why I didnt become a trucker before.	Well, youre not really a trucker now.
Oh, yeah? My left arm says different.	Well, according to Reds schedule, we have to make it to Atlanta in three days.
That little punk. Ill teach him some manners.	No, Dad. He wants you to blow your horn.
Aww... thats a nice, friendly gal.	Yeah.
Wouldnt it be great to live right here at the truck stop? Watching all the people come and go. You could have a different best friend every day.	I suppose.
I bet ol Red caught himself a mess o catfish with these fishing sticks.	Uh-huh. Bet he used bait, too.
Relax, boy. Were ahead of schedule.	Actually, we have to go twenty-two hundred miles in ten hours.
Hey, Bart, watch me run down this old lady.	Dad, no!
Cmon out, boy. Its windy.	Wow, youre right, Dad. It is windy.
Look, son. Its one of natures most beautiful sights -- the convoy.	He hit us!
Aaiieeee!!	Whoa, look at him roll.
I think we lost em, Bart.	Dad, stop!
All right.	What are you doing?
Im keeping a promise to an American roadmaster.	Huh?
Red. The trucker. Big fat guy, couldnt handle his steak?	Oh, yeah.
Dad, do something!	Something better!
Well, son. I guess its time to go home.	Any thoughts on how were gonna get there?
Oh, man. This is the hottest Easter ever.	Even that praying mantis is losin it.
All right, lets go, ya wee Israelites. Back to slavin.	Man, captivity blows.
Take him away, boys.	No! The bush set me up!
We spent all our money, but it was worth it. Now hes gotta let us go!	How am I supposed to get up there?
Well never be able to swim that far.	Oy carumba!
Yayyy! / Manna!	Whoa-ho-ho!
Hey, hey, King David! Ha, ha, how ya doin? Now Im not saying Jezebels easy, but before she moved to Sodom, it was known for its pottery.	What else you got?
No, it was his son, Goliath Two.	Nooo... Goliath Two is gonna pay. And this time its biblical.
I dont know, Davey.	Quiet, you.
See ya later, Davey.	You killed my best friend.
All I need is my trusty sling and one good hard...	Say, hows tomorrow for you?
Say, hows tomorrow for you?	What say you now, Goliath? Without your precious hair, you no longer possess your fantastic strength!
Youre King David! I love you cause you kill people.	Well, get yourself another hero, kid. Im all washed up.
Well, I guess its up to Ralph to stop Goliath.	Goliath Two is really gonna pay. Get ready to meet the first action hero.
Crap.	Jonah! You died the way you lived - inside a whale.
Jonah! You died the way you lived - inside a whale.	Hmm...
I trampled four giant-slayers today. I think I earned this.	Dont you know smoking stunts your growth?
Well, well, well. If it isnt the little Prince.	Im not afraid of you, Goliath. Before I was arrogant. But now, my heart is humble, and my spirit is...
What do you know? A king fit for a meal.	Hope I dont give you heartburn!
Nope!	Rejoice, good people. Goliath the Terrible shall rule no more!
But Goliath was the greatest king we ever had.	Whuh?
Oh no, its the Apocalypse. Bart, are you wearing clean underwear?	Not anymore.
Thats me!	Youre Pop? No offense, but even I could kick your ass.
How bout it, Bart? Would you like a new backyard barbecue pit?	Can I burn evidence in it?
Hows your fathers project coming along?	I think hes almost done.
I think hes almost done.	Yeah, hes done.
Hmm, I dont know. I studied art for years, but I just dont get this.	Sounds like somebodys jealous.
Good work, honey. Keep it comin.	Well, Im flunkin math, and the other day I was a little attracted to Milhouse.
Its glorious! The streets are paved with water. You could ride a walrus to work!	Hit the road, Welcome Home.
Adios, Casa de Flanders.	See you in hell, God Bless This House.
Step two snorkel the animals.	It wasnt easy, but I got all the grizzlies.
Now, step three...	Are you sure this is art, not vandalism?
Hit the road, Lefty. You too, Rizzo.	Thank you! Thank you!
No ones gonna jinx you, Homer. In fact, were rooting for you.	Yeah, go for the gold, Dad!
Well, you said I couldnt do it, but here it is! Meet Abby the Olympic Tabby.	Howd you get the eyes to move?
Knowing you always hate my first idea, I prepared a backup. How about a big Olympic hello for Springy, the Springfield Spring!	Those arent the dogs eyes, are they?
Its fun for the whole family. And the ends are razor sharp to protect our nation and its interests.	Ow!!
Wait! Wait! We have one more act! The patriotic comedy stylings of Bart Simpson!	So, uh, youre from Russia, huh?
Da!	You drunk yet?
Da.	Poland, eh? Ha. Too easy. How you doin, Germany? Heres my impression of an East German woman, Kiss me or Ill crush you.
Im not thinking that!	Hey, Swiss Miss. Theres no missin you, babe. Heh, heh. Lay off the cocoa.
Ha, ha, ha. Laugh it up, ya punks. Cause you and Jan Murray here just cost our town the Olympics!	Hey, Chalmers, where are you from?
Well, just keep working. Youll prick yourself with the antidote sooner or later.	What are you gonna do to me?
Bart, not all community service is gang warfare and dangerous infection. And to illustrate that point, heres where youll be working.	The Fireworks, Candy and Puppy Dog Store?!
Settle a bet. Boil or mole?	Ewwww.
Okay. Just breathe through your mouth and dont ask how theyre feeling.	Oh, man...
Arent you a cutie-petutie. / Lets pull his skin. / Im gonna touch his head.	Yahhh!
Two oclock. Recreation time.	Phew, saved by the bell.
Phew, saved by the bell.	Whoa!
Yes, sweeet.	Thats the prize?! A banana?
Their natural mushiness prevents choking and promotes regularity.	Theyre not babies, Lisa. Give em something fun, like cigars or booze.
Okay. Four oclock. Nap time.	You tell them when to sleep?
Here you go. Make sure you get into every crevice.	Cool. Grampa, Homer. Grampa, Homer.
So, Bart, how was your first day of forced volunteerism?	That place sucks! The nurses dont let Grampa do anything. They practically chew his food for him.
Oh, what a lovely ending.	They cut out the best word!
Picture yourself on a beautiful sailboat. Ahhh, cant you just feel the sea breeze in your hair?... or scalps?	Say, I hear a foghorn. BOR-ING...
Now were pulling into port. And whos waiting for us at the dock? Why, its all your childhood dogs! I see Petey and Blackie and Schnoodle and...	Oh no! Pirates!
Pirates?!	Ahoy mateys, its me, Long Bart Silver and Im gonna rip you a new I.V. hole.
Excuse me, but when those pirates boarded, I swallowed my wedding ring for safekeeping. Get me some ipecac. Id like to expunge it.	Okay, shes gone. Lets break out of here and have some fun!
Padding...	What about you, Chief? Dont you want to be free like the eagle?
You know, the door was open! Chief Break-everything!	Come on, people. You dont want to stay in a place where they vacuum you while you sleep.
They do what now?	Nows our chance. Lets go!
Ow! Todays grass is far sharper than the grass in my day.	Hey, everybody!
Hey, everybody!	Howd you like to go on a real boat trip?
I havent felt this relaxed and carefree since I was watch commander at Pearl Harbor.	Aw, geez, this place used to be crawling with Russian subs. Now theres just four.
Aw, geez, this place used to be crawling with Russian subs. Now theres just four.	Sea hag!
Bart, are you crazy? Youve got to get the old folks home to the Old Folks Home.	No way! Theyre finally having some fun!
I want some pills! / Blue ones! / I want pills!	But Ive set you free. No more nap time, no more bingo. You can do whatever you want!
Ohhh, two glass eyes.	Oh, its not fair. Im not supposed to die now. Im supposed to die in a foolish motorcycle stunt at the age of fifteen.
So, you workin tomorrow at the home, Bart?	Well, I finished my community service.
Ohhh, right.	But I could swing by after school. Ill bring the limbo stick.
Oh, come on, lets go for a walk! This familys getting so lazy.	Im not lazy, Im just um, uhh... Lisa, finish my sentence for me.
Forget it. Nobodys riding any...	Hi-yo Silver, away!
And thats where the bookmobile lady used to live!	If you love me, youll kill me.
Ew!	Whoa! This place has everything! Even a shoplifting department.
Yes, I know, but... still.	Hey, Dad, gimme fifty bucks. I gotta buy some things. Uh, better make it a hundred.
Thats it, the radio! Ill go on the most popular program of the day. I assume thats still Don MacNeil and his Breakfast Club.	Oh, get with the times, man. Its Jerry Rude and the Bathroom Bunch.
No one said Hawaii. Now lets get stupid with our first contestant, the Human Garbage Disposal!	Ladles and jellyspoons, I will now take going low to new heights. I will swallow anything -- and I mean anything -- you people throw.
Ladles and jellyspoons, I will now take going low to new heights. I will swallow anything -- and I mean anything -- you people throw.	Please, no more spark plugs.
We are a town of low-brows, no-brows and ignorami. We have eight malls but no symphony, thirty-two bars but no alternative theater, thirteen stores that begin with Le Sex... I write this letter not to nag or whine, but to prod! We can better ourselves!	Yee-ha!
Try not to speak. Its making your body ripple.	Dad? Dad? Are you home?
The Internet? Is that thing still around?	I know a web site that shows monkeys doin it.
Ewww, this lass needs a bit of groundskeeping. Eh-- Ach, thats Willie!	My name is Mary. Im 45, heavy and willing to settle for less.
Well, maybe for your wedding!	How bout here?
No, no, were going to Paris. I can feel it.	Come on, Transylvania.
Sir, it is not safe to use electronic devices yet.	Youre the waitress.
I think Im gonna be sick.	Mom, Lis! Check it out. Dads on TV.
Whos up for some exploring?	Hey, Im still checkin out Japanese TV.
Hey, Im still checkin out Japanese TV.	Isnt this that cartoon that causes seizures?
Hey, you know, I once knew a man from Nantucket.	And?
Howdy, gangstas! I am Average American Joe Salaryman waiter.	These prices suck! Ten thousand yen for coleslaw?!
Mmm... fifty dollar pretzel. Hey, whats Baby Huey doing?	Says here they throw salt before they wrestle to purify the ring.
I didnt... What is it? Lunch?	Then we had to do two hours of origami, followed by flower arranging and meditation.
Every truck-load of fish we gut brings us 31 cents closer to those tickets home.	And I think Ive finally found what I was put on this earth to do...
And I think Ive finally found what I was put on this earth to do...	Knife goes in, guts come out. Knife goes in, guts come out...
Spare my life and I will grant you three wi--	Knife goes in, guts come out.

Bart, dont...	Quiet! Dads gonna get his butt kicked by Mel Gibson! Knock his teeth out, Homer!
Look, theyre making a movie! Robert Downey, Jr. is shooting it out with the police!	I dont see any cameras.
Okay, while Mel and I are working, why dont you guys do the town? I hear all the stars eat at a place called Planet Hollywood.	Can I stay with you, Dad?
Oh, absolutely, Lisa. That, and the sand bucket.	Whats that stuff?
Why this is retardant.	It sure is!
It sure is!	And whats that?
Thats called a hose lengthener.	You need one.
Bart, will you go bother someone else?	LOOK, A FIRE!...
LOOK, A FIRE!...	... engine.

Cant you do something constructive?	Sure, I can do something destructive!
Uh, roll, Neddie! Roll!	Cant help ya.
Whats it doing in the gymnasium?	Yeee-hawww!
Youve really done it this time.	Yeah, it all kinda came together.
A drug? I know Bart can be rambunctious, but hes not some hyperactive monster.	Gimme an F!
Gimme an F!	Gimme an art!
Its all about trust, honey.	Ow! Knock it off!
Homer, we agreed wed discuss the medication with Bart.	Medication?
Some special helpers thatll make you a good boy.	I dont want to take drugs.
Andy Dick...	Hes just flamboyant.
You choked?! You choked?!	Dad, I admit I have some problems, but drugs arent the answer.
Son, lets forget all about that drug thing. Why dont you just come down and have some taffy?	Nice try, Homer.
Honey, if you dont want to take the medicine, we wont force you.	Really?
Yes, I just thought you might love me enough to let me help you.	Oh, Mom...
Oh, Mom...	All right. Ill do it for you.
Good morning, honey. Hows my special little guy?	Im having some side effects from the dope.
Its not dope! Its something to help you concentrate.	All I know is my testicles wont fit in my underwear.
Oh, grow up.	Yeah.
Ill trade you a Claritin for one.	Claritin D?
All right, class, who would like to read The Daffodils, by Wordsworth?	Ill do it.
All right, people. Weve all seen the dogs now, so...	What?
Youre still in your seat!	Well, its not like I never saw a dog before.
Well, its not like I never saw a dog before.	Cmon, people. This poetry isnt gonna appreciate itself.
Bart! Bart! Krusty just fired his associate producer!	Im reading.
Joke if you will, but did you know most people use ten percent of their brains? I am now one of them. Before, my energy was all over the place. Now its concentrated like a laser beam.	Well, this has been terrific. Lets do it again sometime.
Are you standing up to get me to leave?	Its from the book.
Hey! Im not a Time Burglar!	Memo to self Lock door.
All right, Ill go! You dont have to be a jerk about it.	Memo to self Shut up, Lisa.
Thank you in advance for a world-class meal. Youre an inspiration to our entire organization. Thank you again, Bart. Ohh, what a lovely gesture!	Cost of paper? Five cents. A mothers love? Priceless.
Do I get a card?	No, but heres a book called Chicken Soup for the Loser that gave Bill Buckner the courage to open a chain of laundromats.
Hmm. My career has kinda lost momentum...	I think its the bright blue pants. I mean, youre not on a golf course.
Because... he took his eyes off the prize?	Thats right. You stay on the ball, you stay on the wall.
Bart? Honey?	Gotta finish.
Gotta finish.	Close the door!
Close the door!	Youre probably wondering about the coat hangers. Theyre to block the satellite thats been spying on me.
O-kayyy.	It can read your electronic organizer from space.
Hey, I had Lennys name on that!	They have it now.
Who are they, exactly?	Who else? Major League Baseball.
Oh, Bart, whats happened to you?	Nothing yet. But the time draws near. Now, lets get those fillings out of you.
Thats a great idea!	No! You cant take my Focusyn! I need every brain cell blazing to outwit my invisible enemies!
I know you love Focusyn, son. But in time youll get just as attached to these three amigos.	No!
Youve raised the bar for all of us, Simpson. And I thank you.	Wow. Praise from Caesar.
Why dont you just tell everybody?	Hey, Mom. Thanks for comin out.
Thank you for stopping the tank.	It ran outta gas.
Oh. So, Bart...	Question.
How about getting out of the tank... huh maybe stopping your rampage? Huh? We could go to Krusty Burger...	Okay. Sure.
Major League Baseball?	I told you they were monitoring my activities.
Young Bart here was right. We are spying on you, pretty much around the clock.	But why, Mr. McGwire?
Oh honey, Im so sorry we sent you on that psychotropic hayride.	Hey, at least I got to see some cool colors.
Well, Im not giving my baby any more dangerous drugs. From now on its nothing but fresh air, lots of hugs, and good, old-fashioned Ritalin!	You said a mouthful!
You said a mouthful!	When I cant stop fiddlin / I just takes me Ritalin / Im poppin and sailin, man!
Yes. Now Id like to ask each child to pair up with a buddy, so no one gets lost.	Come to think of it, I havent seen Uter since the last field trip.
Here we are kids -- the zoo.	Well, thats great, Dad, except you were supposed to drive us to the newspaper.
Your old man has an awesome nose.	Oh, thats nothin. He can hear pudding.
Can ya believe it, Marge? This job is the greatest -- theyre paying me to eat!	Yeah, now if you could just get somebody to pay you for scratching your butt, well be on easy street.
And theres the cane from Citizen Kane. Wait a minute. There was no cane in Citizen Kane.	And theres that awful script from The Cable Guy!
Well, dont worry. The giant Ã©clair will knock Homer off the food page... and into the obituaries.	Wait a minute, theyre gonna kill Dad!
Oh, thats-a spicy meatball.	... So if we dont find Dad, this crazy French guy is gonna kill him!
Oh, no!	Ned Flanders!
Oh my God, we killed Ned Flanders!	You mean you killed Ned Flanders.
Weve got to go to the police.	Theyll never believe a Simpson killed a Flanders by accident. Even I have my doubts.
Someone saw us.	But who?
Hes undead, all right.	Are you a zombie?
Uh-oh. Radiation! Duck and cover!	Cool...
Poindexter?!	Whoa, Lis, those X-rays mustve given you super strength. I wonder if I got any powers...
Whoa, Lis, those X-rays mustve given you super strength. I wonder if I got any powers...	Nope, looks normal... Wait a minute.
Nope, looks normal... Wait a minute.	I can stretch!
I can stretch!	Look at me!
Look at me!	Ow! Hot-hot-hot!
Ow! Hot-hot-hot!	I must only use this power to annoy.
Ow!	Gotcha.
Help!	Its Xena! Shes been kidnapped! Come on!
I dont think so!	I dont think so, either.
Stretch Dude! Help!	Just a sec.
Just a sec.	Whoa! Hey, phaser, phaser, phaser -- zing!
Bart, just let me drop and save yourself!	What dyou think Ive been tryin to do?
Best... death... ever.	Wow, thanks for saving us.
Nectar! Nectar! I need to drink my weight in nectar!	Krus-tyyyyyy! Hey, a note.
Krus-tyyyyyy! Hey, a note.	You have been selected for Operation Exodus...
Well, son. I guess this is the end. But weve both had long, full lives. Oh, right.	Hey, look, another spaceship!
I cant believe I destroyed the Earth.	Are you still talking about the Earth?
Ooh, theres Ross Perot, Dr. Laura, Spike Lee...	Wait a minute. Theyre not so great.
Tom Arnold?! What the hells going on?!	Wait. Only that ship is going to Mars. Ours is headed for the sun.
CLANG CLANG CLANG WENT THE TROLLEY! / DING DING DING WENT THE BELL!	Dont worry, Dad. Well be dead in five minutes.
No, no, its a Z! I am Zorro! Z for Zorro! I have come to return King Arthur to the throne!	Its a history lesson come to life.
No it isnt. Its totally inaccurate--	Quiet, here come the Ninjas.
Were just, uh, friends.	Shes lying! Slice her head off!
Oh, Homer, I bet that southern colonel doesnt even show up.	Yeah, hes probably just a big blowhard like you.
Rural route 9? Thats it! We can hide out at the farm where I grew up!	You mean Grampas old farm?
Yeah, itll be fun. Fresh country air, apples for the pickin... sing-along hayrides...	What a dump!
Absolutely. This is our big chance. The Simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.	Ill dig an outhouse.
All right, lets see what the old girl can do.	It doesnt sound very tractor-y.
Go get Lassie.	Lassie?
Yeah, I hope I can grow some like that.	What are you planting?
And for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... Im down.	Paw!
No thanks. Im still finishing my thistles.	Dad, if we leave for town right now, we can catch the dinner special at Krusty-Burger.
Sorry, boy. Going back to Springfield would be a cowards way out.	Wasnt skipping town in the first place a cowards way out?
Homer, no!	Let im go, Mom.
Bup, no fighting, boys.	Bleh! Tastes like cigarette butts.
Oh, great. I got a field full of mutants.	Gimme! I want more!
I thought you said it tasted terrible.	It does. But its smooth and mild. And refreshingly addictive.
Dont push. Theres plenty of tomacco for everyone.	Have your cash or food stamps ready!
Dad, its a tobacco company. They make billions off the suffering and deaths of others.	Shes right, Dad. They can afford a lot more.
Listen, boy... I was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention.	No need, Dad. Over the years Ive learned to find father figures wherever I can... construction workers, the internet... and Nelson, here.
Hes named after what he is.	Cool costume!
Man, the last nine months sure were crazy.	Ill say. I learned the true meaning of Columbus Day.
I became the most popular girl in school, but blew it by being conceited.	And then I learned the true meaning of winter.
Free baby cola? Apu hits the jackpot, and Im stuck with these useless one-tuplets.	Gee, sorry for being born.
Off! Off! Off! Off!	I cant believe were gonna see the octuplets.
You already saw them.	Yeah, but now their umbilical cords have fallen off!
Are those real cobras?	Some are real, some are just robots filled with venom.
What a neat idea!	Why dont we eat there tonight?!
Yes. I was Americas bad boy. I once hid my Dads hat.	Uh-huh.
And another time I accidentally stepped in Mr. Wilsons flowerbed. That was a two-part episode.	I have to go.
Promise you wont laugh?	Yeah, I promise.
I dont know how.	Youre kidding?
Youre kidding?	You dont know how.
Will you teach me?	Of course.
Oh, its like a chainsaw in my head...	Later, Homer.
Just put it on my sewing pile. Okay, Im doing another load of bandanas!	Hey! Hey! Thats a leave-in conditioner!
... And those bikers saw that hard look in my eye -- you know that hard look I get sometimes? -- and they ran away like schoolgirls with their tails between their legs.	Way to go Dad. Hey, wheres the food?
Really? Read it.	Hm. Thanks for letting us crash in your pad. We had a very nice time.
Oh, thats sweet.	P.S. Weve taken your old lady.
Oh, Homie.	Oh, I am so bored.
Our top story The ozone hole that devastated Brazil last summer is apparently wintering in Springfield.	Woo! Springfield rocks!
Aw, the zoning disk is warped...	All right, Silly String!
All right, Silly String!	Look, youre Milhouse.
Ill be in my room.	Theres gotta be something fun in my parents closet.
Wanna dress up like ladies?	Uh, wouldnt that make us kinda... fruity?
Whats the matter, scared you might like it?	Ill show you whos scared. Oh, wow, this really hides my thighs.
Hey, why is this door locked?	Oh, no! Its Dad!
But dont worry, son. It fits snugly under your clothes.	Do all these people have to watch me?
What the...? Bart, wheres your wheelchair?	Dont need it anymore. Doctor says my butt-bones stronger than ever.
Dont need it anymore. Doctor says my butt-bones stronger than ever.	Tah dah!
This play really speaks to me.	I cant take Mr. Burns to the hopital cause Im too dumb to read a map. Oh, why did my school have to close?
Hmm. LimÃ³n -- fuerte. LimÃ³n -- fuerte. LimÃ³n. F-- Ay yi yi yi yi! Mi estÃ³mago.	Daytime TV is muy estupido.
Daytime TV is muy estupido.	Hey, our schools on TV.
What are you passionate about, partner?	Boogers.
Boogers. That was great. You know, humor is a sign of intelligence.	Youre not mad?
Bart broke all my books.	You know what our homework is? Find a toy and bring it to class!
Boy, that sounds fun.	I know, but Im still not gonna do it.
It should be soft and cuddly.	Yeah. With lots of firepower!
The word is irony.	Huh?
Dont you think theres something weird going on here? We spent all day selecting fabric swatches, and then our guest speaker was Phil from Marketing.	Alls I know is Im gettin straight As. And that aint not bad.
Mom! I know what I want for Christmas.	Thanks, Funzo. You rock!
Bart, they lied to us. Instead of giving us an education, they tricked us into designing a toy. Arent you outraged?	No, but if youre gonna throw a spaz, Ill come with.
Get down. Security guard.	Hey, its Gary Coleman.
But the menu said Galaxy of Prawns. Three prawns are hardly a galaxy... Whaddaya mean your hands are tied? Let me talk to Mr. Kwan.	I want to see how this turns out.
How did you get past Gary Coleman?	Lets just say hes a few prawns short of a galaxy.
But hey, we did screw you a little. So heres a free Funzo.	Deal!
All righty!	Its always a party with Funzo!
Did you see that?	Yeah. Funzo makes playtime fun!
They must have programmed it to eliminate the competition.	You mean like Microsoft?
Well, I guess thats it. Come Christmas Eve, therell be a Funzo under every tree.	Unless...
Nobody! Youre just gonna break into everyones house and steal their favorite toy.	Thus saving Christmas.
Seasons Greetings.	Peace out!
Writhing Funzos / In my sack / Makes me happy / Makes me hurt my back...	Just dump em in the fire, Dad.
Thats a very glib interpretation.	Hey, dont talk to my sister that way.
Hey, it is Christmas. Wed better get home.	Hey, Dad... What if we...
Okay, here goes...	Cloning is a troubling issue.
This box? Oh, nothing.	Are you sure? You sound nervous.
Oh. That was scary. We came this close to losing our spare Christmas tree stand. You monster.	Look, heres the box for my Pitchback. If I still had it, I could put it in here.
Hey, lets go skiing right now!	Yeah! Lets go skiing! / Yeah, Dad. Lets go!
Okay, here it comes. Keep your eyes on the chair.	Look Dad, its the drummer from Bread!
Stop it!	Um... I gotta blast a dookie.
Im gettin aggro on this kicker!	Stomp that pickle revert!
Excellent. Your lingo is progressing nicely.	Can I go to the bathroom?
Well be fine, honey. The main thing is for you to get better.	And dont worry, all the laundry and dirty dishesll be there when you get back.
Come on, bikini inspector! Scrub toilet? Okay, that was a practice. Practice... Practice... Okay, here we go. Feed fish.	Ill supervise.
You stay away from Lenny. And wheres your sweater, Bart?	It unraveled on a nail.
Thats not true, he left it on the bus.	Youre dead, squealer.
Bart, you were supposed to scour the pans!	They need to soak.
Look, theyre rusted through.	Its an illusion.
Its the bread of astronauts.	I didnt know Aerosmith made a cereal.
Marco!	Polo!
Marco!	Polo!
Marc--	Polo!
You dont? Cause thats what I said! Tell her, Bart.	Shut up! Shut up!
Any exposure to unsanitary conditions?	Duh! Were pigs!
Youve got leprosy.	Leprosy?!
Leprosy?!	Aahhh! Unclean! Unclean!
Leprosy? I cant believe it! That fortune cookie was right.	Why would God punish a kid? I mean, an American kid?
Mops? The cure sounds worse than the disease.	At Sunday School they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude.
At Sunday School they said the lepers were cured by some bearded dude.	Yeah, that sounds right.
Maude, come quick! The Simpsons are covered with cooties!	/ Help us. / Were diseased.
Thank you for the friendly howdy.	Can we get a room with a view?
Dad, Bart, I played a horrible trick on you and Im really sorry. You dont have leprosy. Its just oatmeal.	Yeah, we know.
Well, then lets get out of here.	No way. We scored a free Hawaiian vacation.
This place is a blast. All we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then its nothin but shopping and surfing.	Tonight were gonna put our fake sores back on, then jump the fence at Club Med, and scare the normals.
NOW LETS HEAR IT / FOR THE HOLY SPIRIT / NO NEED TO FEAR IT / JUST REVERE IT! / HE WORKS IN HEAVEN / THATS TWENTY-FOUR, SEVEN / THATS RIGHT. CHECK THE BIBLE / JOHN TWO-ELEVEN! / JUMP BACK!	Wow! He dances better than Jesus Himself!
/ Hallelujah! / Amen!	That was a miracle and it was gross. Cool.
Have you gone completely fakackta?! I-- Hey, I got my comedy Ks back! King Kong cold-cocked Kato Kaelin. Hey, you Gentiles are all right!	Wow! Is there anything he cant do?
Now proclaim -- I have the power.	I have the power?
Oh, say it like you mean it, boy! I have the power!	I have the power!
Aw, you two were great tonight. You didnt bite me or anything. Hows that little rattle doin?	Scuse me, Brother Faith. I gotta know, how did you really get the bucket off my Dads head?
Well I didnt, son. You did. God gave you the power.	Really? Hm. I would think He would want to limit my power.
Oh, yes Lord! When I was your age I was a hell raiser, too. My slingshot was my cross. But I saw the light and changed my wicked ways.	I figure Ill go for the life of sin followed by the presto-chango deathbed repentance.
Wow, thats a good angle. But thats not Gods angle. Why not spend your life helping people instead? Then youre also covered in case of a sudden death.	Full coverage... hmm...
Can you heal me? I cant breathe good and it makes me sleepy.	Ill give it a whirl, Ralphie boy.
Ow!	Devil be gone!
Bart, I hope you dont believe your own hype.	Number of miracles performed by Bart two. Number performed by Lisa zero.
How can you believe all this mumbo-jumbo? The bucket came off Dads head because the bright lights heated it, causing the metal to expand.	Heat makes metal expand? Now whos talkin mumbo-jumbo?
In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul instructed them to send ten copies to the Thessalonians and the Ephesians. But the Ephesians broke the chain and were punished by...	I got two words for this sermon
Am I boring you, Bart?	Well, to be honest, yes.
Hey, Im doing the best with the material I have.	But church can be fun.
But church can be fun.	No, really. It can be a crazy party, with clouds and lasers and miracles.
And chili fries!	A real preacher knows how to bring the Bible alive through music and dancing and Tae-Bo!
That exterminator tentll be perfect for your revival meeting.	Hm. Maybe we should air it out a little.
Then put your souls together for Brother Bart!	Satan, eat my shorts!!
Yeah! / Yes!	I WAS A SINNER, A REAL BAD KID / WHAT THOU SHALT NOT, I SHALT DID / NEIGHBORS CAT I TRIED TO NEUTER / TOOK A WHIZ ON THE SCHOOL COMPUTER.
HE TOOK A WHIZ... / OH YES HE DID!	BUT NOW IVE CHANGED / YOU CANT DE-NY / COME ON UP AND / TES-TI-FY!
TES-TI-FY	TES-TI-FY! / TES-TI-FY!
My glasses make me look like a geek!	Now youll get the girls you seek!
SO RAISE YOUR VOICE, AND DONT BE SHY / TES-TA, TES-TA...	TES-TI-FY!!!
Thank you, Bart, for fixing my vision / Now I see with total precision.	Songs over, Milhouse. But youre welcome.
Nice doggy!	Milhouse!
Thats okay. You can just heal me again, right?	Well, I dont think I can.
Please. This cast is real itchy, and I tried to scratch and the fork got stuck in there. And I think there was some food on the fork.	Okay, Ill see what I can do.
Okay, Ill see what I can do.	Heal. Heal...
Oh, it always does that.	Milhouse, I cant help you. I am no healer.
Youre the miracle boy with the healin hands, arrrrent ya?	Nah, I dont do that anymore.
So I guess Ill have to see someone else about my cripplin depression. Arrr. Arr.	Wow. And I thought he had it all.
Bart, I need a miracle!	Sorry, Dad. I cant just magically cure a broken leg.
Okay, God. If you did give me a power, let it work now. Not just for me, but for my Dad.	Heal... Heal... Heal...
Well, I assume so. As long as I have Barts healing powers.	Why wont anybody listen to me? I dont have any special powers! I am not a healer!
Wow, hes got every Nancy Drew! Even the controversial Clue in the Clock. So many swears.	Im Al Unser Jr.!
Homer, watch your lang... Oooooh. Thats a lifesaver.	Man, this is livin.
We made it, son. International waters -- the land that law forgot.	Wow, you can do anything out here.
Thrust... Parry... Stabstabstabstab. Oooh, he aint pretty no more.	Hey, Coast Guard! Try and stop us now, you lousy Americans!
We cant hear you. Come 300 feet closer.	Nice try. Youre not gonna nail us!
But we just want to party.	Oh, really? Then play some rock music.
That was my plan all along. Now relax and the currents will take us home.	What about the people on the bottom?
I dont know. After living like a billionaire, this place is kind of a dump.	Nah, its not so bad. Here we can spit on the floor.
A little late for Lenny.	Who are those pleasant old men?
I stand by my disappointed groan.	Check out Lisa. Shes a sax machine! Makes me think I shouldve done something with my life. Oh, well.
Anybody got a building permit? Cause we nailed it!	Way to blow, Lis!
Yeah, right, thats what I meant, Lisa. State Un-fair.	Zing!
Id rather let a thousand guilty men go free, than chase after them. All right, shows over, folks. Im afraid this horse is going to the dog food factory.	You cant do that to Duncan. Its not his fault that his owner was a sleaze.
Mmm, thats terrific, Duncan. Youre ten for ten. Now, lets look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the NFL.	Hes a diving horse. Maybe he could dive for pearls.
Huh?	This horse is pretty fast. Maybe we can race him.
I wonder what would happen if they had a baby?	Dad, if were gonna race Duncan, shouldnt we hire a professional trainer?
You can do it, Duncan. I dont care if your odds are... Five million to one!?	Dont worry, boy. Ill love you even if you dont win.
Whats this? Number 5, Duncan, the horse no one expected to do anything, isnt doing anything. He hasnt even left the starting gate!	Cmon, boy. I know youre scared, but you can do this. I believe in you!
Cheer up, son. I thought you looked damn good out there. Oh, wait. You were number 5? Eew! You stin... Damn good.	Duncans really fast, Dad. He was just intimidated by those other horses.
Furious D?	Hes the bad boy of racing. Hes got attitude and bad-itude, so show him some latitude and youll win his gratitude. Only in America!
Good Lord! What has become of the Sport of Kings?	Get bent.
Yeah, Im shakin in my silks. Ooo, ooo, ooo.	Dont listen to em, D. Just remember, youve got a new persona. A new per-so-na.
Wait a minute... Hang onto your monocles, cause Furious D is closing like a horse possessed!	Thats it, D. Dont let anyone push you around. Be as bad as you wanna be.
Son, dont ask why, but you have to lose the big race.	You want me to lose the Springfield Derby? But you always taught me that winning was everything.
Oh, it is, it is. But weve been pushing that poor horse too hard.	Maybe. But if Duncan wins the Derby, he can spend the rest of his days as a stud.
Well, it is a good life, believe me... All right, well give it a shot. Ill deal with those murderous trolls.	Huh?
That doesnt sound like bees.	Oh my God, its a racetrack!
Better do what he says, Marge.	Cool! Way to adapt, little guy.
Eh, ah, woo. There it is.	Mr. Babcock, can I take a ride in your car?
Bart, these are the time trials that determine the pole position...	Shouldnt you be keeping your hands on the wheel?
Sure, if you want to drive the traditional way.	Whoa!
Sorry.	Boy, these cars are surprisingly roomy.
Abso-not-ly, hot Roddy. Were up here, out of range of the crashes and the drivers cussing.	Move your damn butt.
Bart? Honey, I think you should go play with Rod and Todd.	Oh, man. Why does everything bad have to happen to me?
Kindness?	Oo, tough room. Video games. Whaddaya got? Billy Grahams Bible Blaster?!
Keep firing! Convert the heathens.	Got im!
Look out, Bart! The gentle Bahai!	All right! Full Conversion! Thanks guys. This really cheered me up.
Can we play now?	You are playing. Were a team.
Oh, yeah. Thats it, baby, thats the money shot. Yeah, the camera loves you. Oh-ho-ho, you tease, you.	Why are you taping Flanders, Dad?
Youll see...	Do you even have a job anymore?
Oh-ho-ho-ho, thats great. Chicks really dig sensitivity. Did you get that, Bart?	Got it.
Hey, Im as surprised as you, but Ive stumbled upon the most delicious British sit-com.	Do Shut Up?
Its about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. If theyre not having a go with a bird, theyre having a row with a wanker.	Cheeky.
The Mothers the voice of reason.	Here come the cricket bats.
If you like great PBS programs like Do Shut Up, and Shut Yer Gob, youll want to support our pledge drive.	Pledge drive?
Done and done.	Dad, you dont have ten thousand dollars.
Missionary work?	Hes dead, isnt he?
Really? Without TV, its hard to know when one day begins and the other ends.	I miss you, Dad. Mom wont let me read Hagar the Horrible.
Oh, really? Well, if youll excuse me, Ive got some civilization to spread like butter on the English muffin that is these people, with all their little nooks and crannies...	Dad, are you licking toads?
Ive just reviewed your ten-year performance record and its appalling.	But Im not Homer Simpson...
I think I know who Homer Simpson is. In ten short years youve caused seventeen meltdowns! One is too many!	Yeah, but...
You sold weapons-grade plutonium to the Iraqis! With no mark-up!	But...
Guess who I saw at the supermarket today!	Can it wait? I just got off work!
Thats it, Bart. Youre taking this man-of-the-house thing too far.	Youre right, Im sorry. Tell you what Saturday night well go out for steaks, just you and me.
Now youre charming!	You dont know me.
Kids, would you like a balloon?	Yeah, right, Mom. Then Id like a rattle and a wowwipop. Actually, I would like a wowwipop.

HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA, HI-HOW-ARE-YA.	I gotta get in that casino.
Gabbo! Youve become a real boy!	All right! Time for some underage gambling. So long, sucker!
All right! Time for some underage gambling. So long, sucker!	Eep.
So, you like to sneak into casinos?	I wasnt gonna gamble. I just wanted a Bloody Mary.
Listen to me. Unless you change your deceitful ways, I foresee a life of bitterness and failure for you... Bart Simpson.	Howd you know my name?
Your father just took out a second mortgage downstairs. Youre listed as collateral.	Oh. I thought maybe you were some kind of Indian mystic who could tell the future.
Who says Im not?	Whoa!
If you want to see your future, throw a treasured personal item into the fire.	Okay.
Not a firecracker!	Hey, I bought it from a guy on your reservation.
Thats crazy talk.	No, its true.
Check, check. Hello, Capital City!	Way to make a guitar, Sears.
Any clean towels?	Nah. Use this.
You could at least do some laundry. I pay the rent.	Dude, you know Im good for it. Ill have plenty of money when my lawsuit pays off.
You mean the spider bite at Disneyland?	Or the incident with the over-salted fries...
Hey, dingus, your band can play at my club tonight.	Yes!
But I can only pay you in popcorn shrimp. Smell ya later.	I cant believe smell ya later replaced goodbye.
Smell ya later.	All right! Weve got our first gig!
But you traded your amplifier for a boogie board.	No prob. Ill just mooch some green off my folks.
Should we take the hoverbus, or the non-hoverbus?	Nonhover.
Not half as good as cyberfudge.	Yo, its me.
Oh, what a bleak, horrible future we live in!	Dont you mean present?
Oh, here we go.	Hey, Dad. My band finally got a break. I just need a little moolah to get my amp outta hock. How about a little loanski?
Oh, Im tired of giving you money. Why cant you be more like Lisa?	I am so sick of hearing about Lisa. Just because shes doing a little better than me...
Shes President of the United States.	President-Elect. I couldve been President, but Im too real. People cant deal with what Im layin down. Theyre just like, Whoa, dude, you cant say that. And Im like, Watch me.
Were not giving you money.	But I want some.
You shouldve thought of that before you dropped out of the DeVry Institute.	What happened to you, man? You used to be cool.
Im still cool.	Nah, youve changed, man.
Ah yeah, I never shoulda had that trendy laser surgery. It was great at first, but you know, at the ten-year mark, your eyes fall out.	Listen, dude...
Oh, hi Bart. How much this time?	Dude, you got me all wrong...
Yeah. Just answer me this Are you holding your mooching sack?	My little one.
Bart, youre never gonna to grow up if I keep bailing you out.	Then please, help me help myself.
Hey, yall ready to party?	Now, wed like to play a Jimmy Buffet song, but he un-coolly charges people to cover them. So heres a Capn Bart original. WASTED ONCE MORE IN DAQUIRITAVILLE...
Now weve got no home, no money, and our bands going nowhere. And its all your fault. Smell ya later, Bart. Smell you later forever.	Hes right. Im a loser. Theres only one way out of this mess.
From around the globe, to your frontal lobe, this is BrainVision News. Tonights winning lotto number 4-4-6.	Damn! I was so close! I had 3-2-7.
In other news, President-Elect Lisa Simpson moves into the White House tomorrow. The seventeen-bedroom home features free long-distance, laundry service, and three food-kitchens.	Well, Im the Presidents no-good brother. Moochie-moochie.
Fifteen-ninety-six...	Fifteen-ninety-eight...
Fifteen-ninety-eight...	Sixteen hundred. Sweet...
No. And weve borrowed from every country in the world.	Quick, Lisa! Call off your...
Bart!	Ow! Watch the ponytail!
What are you doing here?	I knew youd need some help keepin it real, so I figured I could be, like, your co-President.
Co-President? Are you crazy?	Mo-om, Lisa wont share.
Oh!	Bewitched marathon.
Hey, thats my helicopter!	Yeah, I sent it to pick up Ralph. No one was using it.
Bart, you do not send a billion-dollar helicopter to pick up your drinking buddy.	Youve changed, Lisa. You used to be cool.
I am proud to honor the players of the Negro Leagues of Rollerball. And as we strive for the desegregation of all deathsports, we cannot help but be inspired by...	Heads!
Heads!	Hey, you guys owe me a frisbee. A new one.
Bart, get out of here!	Relax, Lis. Youll live longer.
I cant relax! Being president is hard work. Maybe you should try doing something with your life.	Im gonna!
Yeah. Did you even call about that messenger job?	Yeah, but they said I wouldnt get my first check for two weeks! Meanwhile, theyre making major interest on my salary. Hey, maybe I can sue em.
Thirty seconds, Madam President.	Hey, Lis. I need a favor.
Not now, Bart. Im about to speak to a hundred million people. This speech could make or break my presidency.	I hear ya. All I want you to do is play my demo tape in the background while youre yakkin about whatever.
I hear ya. All I want you to do is play my demo tape in the background while youre yakkin about whatever.	Now, this PLAY buttons a little screwed up, so you gotta hold it down.
Are you insane?	What? You told me I should do something with my life.
Five seconds!	Mom!
The months ahead will be long and arduous. But it is only through arduousity th...	IF YOU LIKE REFUND ADJUSTMENTS / AND THE MUSIC I PLAY / SEND A CHECK TO MY FRIEND RALPH / AND HELL MAIL YOU A TAPE...
Uh, this is my brother Bart, who doesnt seem to realize this isnt the best time for his music. Hes one of the people I want to help with my programs.	Hey Lis, my music is going to make it a lot easier for America to swallow your big tax hike.
TAPE! HE SAY TA-APE-O.	POST OFFICE BOX 3-0-4-5-2...
Why you little...	Help! Secret Service!
Cmon. Every President gets three secret murders. If you dont use them by the end of the term, theyre gone.	All right, which one of you suits ran over my moped? I just put a dollars worth of gas in that thing.
Bart, were having a meeting.	You had a meeting this morning.
I have a lot of meetings. Im the President.	Of what? The United States of Dorksylvania?
Of what? The United States of Dorksylvania?	Dont leave me hangin, Greenspan.
You know something, Bart? Youre right. My lack of coolness is really holding America back.	Thank you. Down low.
Thank you. Down low.	Too slow!
Youre too much, Bart. Thats why Im appointing you Secretary Of Keeping It Real.	Wow. Youre really asking for my help?
Absolutely. I want you and your pals to go away to Camp David and write up a report on coolness.	Well, if my country needs me... Can we skinny-dip?
Well, if my country needs me... Can we skinny-dip?	Settle down. I invited you guys here to help me with this report. Any ideas?
Whats the difference between Pakistan and a pancake? I dont know any pancakes that were nuked by India. What? Too soon?	Come on, people. Weve got to buckle down here. When were finished, we can go through Bill Clintons porno stash...
Coolness report? Ha, you been had, boy.	Billy Carters ghost?!
Damn straight. And Im here to tell ya, you been sent on a wild goose chase.	You mean Lisa wanted to get rid of me?
Well, thats a big ten-four. When my brother Jimmy was making peace in the Middle East, he sent me to belly-flop academy.	I guess I am an embarrassment.
You sure are. Hey, theres an embarrassment to riches at the Caesars Pow-wow Indian Casino. You can bet on it!	You put an ad in my vision?
Bart, youre supposed to be at Camp David.	Youre meeting with debt collectors and you dont want my help? Do you know how crazy that is?
Youre meeting with debt collectors and you dont want my help? Do you know how crazy that is?	Guys, the thing is, we totally have the money. And we tried to wire it to you, but you know how banks screw up.
I do not understand.	We tried to call you all day Saturday...
We were there Saturday.	Dude, I know. And I left a message with some guy named Hans.
Hans?	He might have been a temp. Very surly.
You pay now! Now!	What happened to you, China? You used to be cool.
Hey, China is still cool. You pay later! Later!	Solid. The rest of you, go on home and look in your mailboxes. Cause I totally remember sending checks out.
Thanks Bart, you bought us some time. What can I do to thank you?	Legalize it.
Legalize what? Oh, oh. Consider it done.	Tasty. That calls for some tuneskis.
Tasty. That calls for some tuneskis.	Oh, great. Anyone have a paper clip?
Uh, it gets kinda hazy after that.	Why did a vision of my future include a story about Homer and Lincolns gold?
I guess the spirits thought the main vision was a little thin. Anyway, the point is, you still have the power to change your future.	Ill do my best.
Youre a good kid. Heres a coupon for some crab claws.	Hey, this is expired!
Really? Anything good?	Ill say! Ive got my own band! And a Moped.
What about me?	Eh, some government job.
Ah, trash night. In France, they call it La Nuit Des Poubelles. In Germany, its Crappenfest.	I cant believe it only comes fifty-two times a year.
They spoilt you, Brandine. Sometimes I dont even know who you are anymore.	Looks like Milhouses mom finally threw out his blanky.
Looks like Milhouses mom finally threw out his blanky.	Hell pay a lot to get this back.
Well, this muscle shirts a pretty good find.	Dad, thats a sports bra.
All I know is, Im finally getting the support I need.	Look, Dad. Barber hair.
Look, Dad. Barber hair.	Ooo, Italian.
Whoa, tha... that, thats a project Im working on. Sorry.	Okay, Mom. Were rolling.
Did Gaga just say hurt everyone?	Gaga. Cute name.
To enter, send your film to this address. Too quick? Try again. Did you get it? Here it is! Coming in from the left! Dont delay - do it today!	You think we should enter?
Hmmm.	Its gotta be here somewhere.
Its gotta be here somewhere.	Hey, heres a camera.
And its still got a roll of film in it.	Man, these old cameras are really built solid.
Bart, we need that to win the contest.	Win the what now?
Now, when the mama bird returns to feed her babies, well have a prize-winning picture.	Lisa, people these days dont want to see a baby bird. They want to see celebrities at their worst.
Is that Rainier Wolfcastle?	Check out the gut!
Hey! No fair! Well never get a good picture.	Hey, why dont we dump spaghetti on Maggies head?
Hey, why dont we dump spaghetti on Maggies head?	Picture?
Boy, you can see everything from Mount Springfield. The Squidport, the old monorail...	The Play-Doh Factory...
Crescent-moon! Crescent-moon!	Cmon, Springfield. Sparkle for me, baby. Thats it...
Cmon, Springfield. Sparkle for me, baby. Thats it...	Heads up.
Ow! Bart, thats hot!	I said heads up.
Say hello, Captain Jack!	We should be safe up here. Im pretty sure fires cant climb trees.
Ow!	Dad!
Let me know if youre gonna do that again, Homer.	You did it, Dad!
What?	Now, theres a picture.
Isnt it adorable? I guess some baby pictures were on that old roll of film.	Well be the laughingstock of the whole town!
...And three makes three.	This isnt real money. Its printed by the Montana Militia.
Ooh, my first issue of Self-Test Monthly. Finally I get to find out what makes me tick.	Im betting its hunger and rage.
Oh, boy. Disappointed? I had the blues like Chasens had chili. I said to myself, Evans, you forgot Hollywood rule number one Kill Homer Simpson.	Hey, whats all the screaming?
Mom! Barts sitting next to me!	Mom! Lisas growing!
Only convicts and hoboes.	Do you have any hobo chunks we can throw to him?
ROCK AND ROLL.	Dad, look out!
LOOK OUT FOR WHAT?	THE GI-ANT GATOR!
You took the signs out of the window? Thats pretty presumptuous. How do you know Im going to hire you?	Sorry. I just want to be a broom boy so bad.
Those noxious gasses from the swamp must magnify them.	Im gettin used to this country life. Teacher says Im whittling at a tenth-grade level.
Yep, this place is great. And someday, when Lisa and Bart get married, itll all be theirs.	Yuk!
Okay, but I aint payin for two weddins.	Hey, wake up! Were moving.
Well, dont that beat all? I guess you folks just stunned him.	Flavors gone.
North Dakota, here we come!	Ive always wanted to see Mount Rushmore.
Thats South Dakota.	Oh.
Come on, Bart. While your dad gets his glasses, well go shop for your trip.	I hate shopping. Just get me a deck of cards, and Ill win whatever I need from the other kids.
But you need to try things on! Every brand has a different idea of Husky.	Im in tantrum position. T-minus five... four... three... remembering dead cat for real tears, and...
Fine, you win. Ill do your shopping for you.	Tantrum averted. But now I cant forget the cat.
Much better.	Dad!
Camp is gonna be great! Seven days without parents, homework or ear medicine.	Yes sir, this is gonna be the best week of our young lives.
Im gonna pound you two all week.	Whatd we do?
Haw haw.	Now where do we go?
I dont wanna go home. My grandmas sleeping in my bed, and she has skin like a basketball.	Wait a minute. Everybody thinks were at camp this week. We can stay wherever we want.
Yeah, like the Four Seasons. Each room has its own safe!	Ive got a better place.
The mall?	Yeah. Its just like my dad always says...
Okay, folks. You heard the recording. Clear out.	Quick. Up here.
Where are we going?	Quiet. Just keep scurrying.
Worms!	Gold! Wait, this is just chocolate. Chocolate!
Yes!	Flavors gone.
Shoe fight!	Ow! No golf shoes!
Ow! No golf shoes!	Ready, Milhouse?
Whoa!	Were lumberjacks!
I like those odds.	Perfect.
Would you?	Can you see the lion anywhere?
Well, do you see him or not?	Are you saying hes right on the other side of that plant?
Stop hittin yourself! Stop hittin yourself! Stop hittin yourself!	Tonight, on the Discovery Channel Inside Lisas Nose.
Tonight, on the Discovery Channel Inside Lisas Nose.	What will we find? Boogers... or Nazi gold?
Bart, quit it!	No way.
Bart sleeps with Raggedy Andy.	Cut! Cut! Cut!
Cut! Cut! Cut!	Otto, a red traffic light means what?
Uh... I know you do. Baby.	Otto, since when have you had a girlfriend?
Ooh, were cordially invited... this Saturday... to join Otto and Becky at... 742 Evergreen Terrace? Thats our address!	I told Otto he could have the wedding here. Hope thats okay.
You should have asked first, Bart. Weddings are hard work and cost thousands of dollars.	Hey, itll be easy. Youve still got most of the stuff from Apus wedding back there.
Oh, Mom, youre not supposed to throw rice anymore. Birds eat it, their stomachs swell and they explode.	Why am I just learning this now?
The bitterness is strong in this one.	So, any words for the bride and groom?
Not now, Bart. Im trying to urinate.	You dont seem to be trying very hard.
I feel so alone. What am I going to do?	Hey, why dont you stay with us?
CH-CH-CH-CHANGES / TIME TO CHANGE THE OIL / YEAH / CHANGES / DONT WANNA BE AN OILY MAN /	A man innocently changes his oil, when... a two-ton car comes crashing down!
A man innocently changes his oil, when... a two-ton car comes crashing down!	Crashing down!
Crashing down!	Whod have thought you could hold up a car with a wicker basket?
Ooo, ooo, Ive always wanted to use rosemary in something.	Mom, this gravy tastes better than Gods sweat.
Ah, its cool. Were just putting some Jackie Chan moves into Barts video project.	Yeah, Mom. I need something great. Milhouse has footage of himself falling down the stairs.
Homer!	Relax, hes gorging.
Relax, hes gorging.	Okay, maybe not.
But for now, this reporter prays that Mad Marge can be captured before she kills again.	Kills again? She hasnt killed once!
Oh, I really miss Mom.	The kids are saying if you say Bloody Margie five times, shell appear. But then she gouges your eyes out.
Why you little...!	Cut! Cut!
Cut! Cut!	Mom, its great to have you back, but you walked right into my shot.
Well, thats a relief, too, knowing Im not crazy. So I guess everything really worked out for the--	Mom!
They told us what to wear, how to dress, which clothes we should put on...	The cops found me driving on the sidewalk.
Sheriff Lowbrow...	Home Improvement...
But we never saw people like us on TV.	TV families were always hugging and tackling issues.
Not now. Im busy turning on this washing machine.	Simp-son!!! Wheres my dinner?!
Good.	I first knew the show was a hit when I walked into school, and a kid was wearing a Bart Simpson T-shirt.
I first knew the show was a hit when I walked into school, and a kid was wearing a Bart Simpson T-shirt.	Fox had an endless supply of clever slogans, man.
The Simpsons was a smash. Viewers couldnt get enough of the shows fractured take on the modern family.	The funniest stuff came right out of real life.
Son, lets go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes.	Cowabunga, dude!
Aaaand cut!	Dad, Ive never said Cowabunga! in my life. Your script sucks.
Convinced that the good times would never stop rolling, the Simpsons moved out of their trademark house...and into MC Hammers.	We found a secret room that was filled to the ceiling with parachute pants. Im wearing some now.
Wow...	The script originally called for me to jump the gorge. But Id been up all night paying people to kiss, so Dad volunteered to do the stunt.
Bart, if its not too much trouble...	Fine! Ill do Teen Wolf III. Ive got fair-weather friends to feed.
Now Homer, this is no time to be thinking about food.	Yeah, forget the donuts! Were here to go-nuts! Musically, that is!
Swings!	Rocks!
Swings!	Rocks!
Folks, were just having a little family tiff. If youll just bear with us...	Oh, shut up! Always trying to act so mature... Im glad you make the least money.
The other family members were also spreading their creative wings. Bart replaced Lorenzo Lamas in the syndicated action series Renegade.	If Esposito thinks hes going to muscle us, hes wrong.
Not again. Timesaver my ass!	When Willie asked me to be a presenter at the New Awareness Awards, I had to think about it... for about a microsecond.
... which Homer writes himself.	So you know its great.
I wanna see Wilmington!	I wanna visit a screen door factory!
Son, I dont like you watching that fire. Its too violent.	Youre missing the best part, Sister. Forget that stupid book.
But these fairy tales take me away from the harsh reality of peasant life.	Oh, its not so bad...
Oh, its not so bad...	Ow!
Ow!	I just got over the plague.
What?! Oh, why are the oafs always the first to go?	Maybe you could be a dunce, Father.
Hmm... Bowls of porridge... Oh, this seems somehow familiar... Lets see...	Hmm... Oh, whoa! Too hot!
Hmm... Oh, whoa! Too hot!	Too cold. Well, this doesnt take a genius...
Were in The Three Bears house!	That was close!
Wait, let me check the book.	Eh, she seems nice. Im gonna go with my gut and trust her.
Oh, this is horrible!	Horribly delicious.
You know shes only fattening you up so she can eat you.	Eh, whatre you gonna do?
Stop your jabbering and sweep! This house is filthy!	So, what do you care? Its not like you have friends.
Well, were still poor, but thanks to your father, well never go hungry.	Speaking of which, how about seconds?
Lets give Snorky a big hand!	Woo hoo! Yay Snorky!
Ach! You want streaks? Cause if you interrupt me, thats what youll get.	Its approaching the podium!
Here you go, boy. Soups on.	Hey, if youre out here, then whos in there?
Hey, if youre out here, then whos in there?	Whoa, a badger! Sorry man, you cant crash here. Cmon, lets go.
Whoa, a badger! Sorry man, you cant crash here. Cmon, lets go.	Well boy, looks like youve got yourself a roommate.
Well, according to WhatBadgersEat.Com, Badgers subsist primarily on a diet of stoats, voles and marmots.	Hmm... stoats, stoats...
Stoats are weasels, Bart. They dont come in cans.	Then whats this?
That says corn, Bart.	Must you embarrass me?
Here we are. In a pinch, badgers have even been known to eat woodpeckers.	Hey, Todd! Can we borrow your woodpecker?
I guess so. But we need him back by six. Its his birthday.	Okay.
Television broken?	No, theres a badger in there.
Its a badger all right... Or possibly a griffin. Bart, do you have any dynamite in your room?	Tons.
Hey, thats not me!	Dad, were not in their area code anymore.
Its not fair! Ive been a fan of the Who since the very beginning, when they were the Hillbilly Bugger Boys.	You should call that radio station and let em have it.
Nice wiring, Bart.	It worked on the test-corpse.
Read my lips Yes.	Dad, you got syrup on your sash.
Hey, look what I found! A novelty flying disc!	Give it back! Thats my novelty flying disc.
Get em!	My homework is in your park.
Oh yeah? They think theyre better than us, huh? Bart, cmere a minute.	You cmere a minute.
Im so conflicted.	Bout what?
Uh...	Dad, the chloroform!
What the hell are you doing?!	Duh. Trashin the hotel room.
This watermelon wont know what hit it.	I love our Tuesdays together, Dad.
Dont you two have a list of chores to do?	Hey, we just took care of that dangerous melon that was threatening our garden.
Eh, its hopeless.	Or is it?
Yeah, its hopeless.	I said, or is it?
Well, like all Americans, fast.	Clear!
It is my birthday.	Thats the spirit. Now, what do you want to do?
Finally, books for todays busy idiot. Network Programming for Dummies... Christianity for Dummies... Mo-- Moby Dick?... Call me Ishmael, Dummy.	How did you write all these books?
So, you really know Krusty? Whats he like?	Oh, hes wonderful. He would do anything for his fans.
Name.	Hey, its me, Bart. Your biggest fan?
Hey, good for you, cause I wanna...	K. the C.?
Thats a good boy.	Mush, Homer, mush!
Krusty the Clown is brought to you by the new GameStation 256. Its slightly faster... to the maaaaax!	Two-fifty-six?
Two-fifty-six?	And Im stuck with this useless two-fifty-two?
Heres a headline for Jay. Ketchup Truck Hits Hamburger Stand.	Mom, can I have two hundred bucks for a two-fifty-six K GameStation? Thats less than a dollar a K!
WHEN YOU GET A PENNY FROM A CHUM / DONT JUST BUY SOME BUBBLE GUM! PUT IT IN YOUR CAP! PUT IT IN YOUR CAP! WHEN YOU FIND A NICKEL IN THE SNOW / DONT JUST BLOW IT ON A PICTURE SHOW PUT IT IN YOUR CAP / PUT IT IN YOUR CAP...	I dont have a cap.
You want money? Get a job, like your old man.	Well, maybe I should.
So, now youre smarter than your old man, eh?	I guess.
Nice days work, kid. This is for you...	Youre paying me in hair?
Youre paying me in hair?	What are you, insane?
You hang Thai menu on door. I get more business. Send daughters to small liberal arts college. Swarthmore, maybe Sarah Lawrence. Call professors by first name... Ha! Dynamite!	Hang em on the door. Got it.
You quitta! Quitta boy! Quitta boy!	Im sorry.
Now restaurant fail. Children go to state college. Serious students powerless against drunken jockocracy. Baseball hats everywhere!	Hey man, this job is too dangerous.
Bart, do you know how many trees died to make those menus?	Iunno. A million?
Youre ruining the earth.	True, but I gots to get paid. Money equals funny, sister.
True, but I gots to get paid. Money equals funny, sister.	Betty.
Bart, its so sweet of you to take the family out to Krustyburger.	Hey, some people in this family are do-ers, and some are dont-ers.
No I dont!	Lisa and Jesse, sittin in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g!
So Bart, our school policy is to give students in your situation straight As.	Get out! Whats the catch?
The tragic loss of your sister.	Ah, yes. Ghastly business, that.
Yeah, but Im still fightin for the earth. I even got em to install a solar-powered electric chair.	And for the first time in my life, education was the answer.
HAPPY FIRST A, BART SIMPSON! / HAPPY FIRST A TO YOU!	Thank you, thank you!
An A in astronomy. Howd you do it?	I just buckled down and studied.
No, really.	Well, it all started last week in Krabappels class...
I needed to get my mind on something else. Anything else.	Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars...
Cmon, Edna, dont be tardy!	Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto...
Im so proud! My dad will be the grand finale of the Thanksgiving Day Parade.	Wanna rehearse, Dad?
I dont need to rehearse. Ho, ho, ho, Merry... Line!	Christmas.
Thats right, Kent Brockman. Our broadcast is brought to you by Costingtons Department Store -- The thing downtown thats open. Right next to the mens shelter.	Rusty the Clown?! Springfield gets the lamest balloons.
Dont touch me! Nothing gives you that right!	Oh yeah...
Youd think all the noises would be annoying, but theyre not.	I got suspended from school today.
No kiddin. What do you think of my page, Lisa? Be honest. Its great, isnt it? Go ahead and say its great if you want to.	They found a switchblade in my locker.
Well... a web page is supposed to be a personal thing. Youve just stolen copyrighted material from everyone else. They could sue you for that.	I took a swing at a cop.
They cant sue me if they dont know who I am. Ill just call myself Mr. X.	Im just mad all the time.
That lousy pothole! Why dont they fix it?	I heard Mayor Quimby spent the street repair fund on a secret swimming pool for himself.
Get out! Who told you that?	Nelson.
Nelson has never steered me wrong, honey. Nelson is gold.	You know, it mightve been Jimbo.
Arent there any evil movies on? Maybe something about an evil island?	Theres something really different about you, Dad.
Hey...	Nice to have you back, Homer.
Wow, Mom got a laugh.	I wish she drank every day.
There we go. And well skip right ahead to the Kill-o-tine .	Ooh, baby!
So she was made of chimps.	Man, magic can do anything!
Get em off me! Get em off! Get em off!	Cool! A gift shop.
Cool! A gift shop.	Ages 8 to 80. Hmm... Thats me! Dad, will you get me this magic kit?
Thats a party magic college.	It is not!
Ya-huh!	Nuh-uh!
I cant afford that.	Maybe I can make some money, Dad. My magic act is really coming along.
Okay, well move. We dont want any trouble, fellas.	Dad, only one of them is real.
Sixty cents?! I wouldve made more if Id gone into work today!	Hey, dont blame me. I gotta compete with TV, and the Internet.
A good son would come through for his dad!	Yeah, and a good dad wouldnt miss his sons Little League games!
I told you! I find them boring.	Well, I showed up for all your stupid interventions.
Oh, thats it! You can walk home!	Dad, come back! I cant walk home with all this stuff!
Stupid, non-magical son, cant pay to fix my car.	Hey, Homer! Check it out!
Is that a steak?	Yeah, I know a little place.
Who gave you all this money?	People. I guess they thought I was a charity case.
Oh ho, ho, thats beautiful! We could make a fortune.	But wouldnt that make us con artists?
Well, yeah. But God conned me out of sixty-five hundred bucks in car repairs.	So in a way, wed just be balancing out the universe.
There ya go! Wed be stealing from people we know. Its just like the seasons.	Sounds good. Wanna eat my fat?
They have any father-and-son grifts?	Well, theres the Albany Ham Scam.
Interesting.	Oh, wait. Here we go...
You bet. Lets trim the mark.	Nice use of the lingo, Homer.
Oh, excuse me!	What happened? Wheres my cake? Its all right, isnt it?
... of integrity.	Wow, look at all this loot! What should we buy first?
Howd you do your act? You left your magic kit here.	Or so it would seem...
Oh, you lost your doggie?	Yeah, I saw him playing in the water, and then he was gone. He had a bright red leash, with bells on it.
Oh, dear Lord!	Hes the bestest dog ever. Hes light brown and he has a spot on him shaped like a heart.
Sorry son, but...	I just gotta get him back!... Or if not him, a similar dog...
Hey, thanks, chief.	My Bar Mitzvah cake! Oy, Ill never be a man!
Yes, son?	Why are we still grifting? The cars paid for. Doesnt that balance out the universe?
In a way. But I also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. Plus the baldness.	Okay, Im sold.
Well, Ill just reimburse you right n-- Wait a minute. This seems an awful lot like that movie, Paper Moon.	Run, Dad!
Well be safe here.	That was too close. Maybe its time to quit the game.
Thats right.	You dont smoke a pipe.
Are you kiddin? They used to call me Grifty McGrift. I wrote the book on flim-flammin.	Wow, he did.
Oh... my... God.	I dont know... Fleecin old people?
Hes dead.	Oh, this is terrible. Now who do we give the money to?
I guess well just have to haul the check back to headquarters. Too bad we couldnt just give it to these nice folks.	Forget it, Ed. Do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big? Why, the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head.
Youre under arrest for fraud.	Throw the book at him, Sonny.
Thanks, woo, it took a lotta grifting.	Please, FBI man, dont throw us in jail. We just made one mistake.
So long, suckers! Woo hoo!	Thats not an FBI badge.
Colgate Cavity Patrol?	That guy was a grifter!
Absolutely. We had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... Bart, would you call him a crazy man?	Definitely. Well, crazy about carjacking.
Well, hmm, lets see, he was foreign and he had some...	Wild, bushy hair, like an animal.
Uh, well, he seemed like a loner... kept to himself, mostly.	And he said if we went to the cops, hed come back for Maggie.
They always say theyre innocent. Its such a turn-off.	Dad, Willie got arrested cause of us!
Im going to allow it. It characterizes the defendant as a carjacker.	Dad, weve got to tell everyone the truth.
Carjacker Willie, I sentence you to ten years in prison.	Dad! Tell them!
Youll never send me up the river!	Daa-ad!
Nice work, everybody!	Wait a minute. This whole thing was a set-up?!
I look like cable TV.	What about that bullet hole in your hair?
And its open season on savings at Springfield Menswear... which is closed.	Oh, everyones off but us.
I dont care if youre Kristi Yamaguchi. No one leaves the building.	This stinks. Well miss the Itchy and Scratchy where they finally kiss.
Uh, now children, if you have to answer natures call during the night, use this bucket next to Barts head.	Hey!
All right, lights out.	Im tired of taking orders from G.I. Jerk. Im gonna tunnel outta here.
I know it looks like the path to freedom, but one collapse and presto, youve got a snow casket.	I was gonna put buttresses in.
Help, its caving in!	Whats the problem, Seymour? Stuck?
Thats precisely the problem and you know it. Now get me out of here!	Whats that? You want the pee bucket on your head?
Cmon, were takin over the school!	Thats it. Cinch it up around the neck.
All right, thats it! Im writing all your names on the detention list in my mind.	Silence, Seymour. Were in charge now. Your reign of fussiness is over.
Silence, Seymour. Were in charge now. Your reign of fussiness is over.	Attention, the school is now under kid control. You are hereby ordered to go nuts!
Stupid ice. I always knew I would die caked in something.	Well, better turn off that engine. Before those fumes put us in tombs.
I cant write this. Its a grammatical nightmare.	Mau! Didi mau!
Mau! Didi mau!	Im getting a cramp in my wrist!
Im getting a cramp in my wrist!	Oh, boo hoo. After all the times Ive done it, my wrist sounds like a cement mixer.
Oh, boo hoo. After all the times Ive done it, my wrist sounds like a cement mixer.	Come on, Seymour! Mau! Didi mau!
Come on, Seymour! Mau! Didi mau!	Ow! I told you, no one can climb a rope. Its physically impossible!
Ow! I told you, no one can climb a rope. Its physically impossible!	What part of didi mau dont you understand?
Nelson, put that globe down! Milhouse, stay out of my desk! Jimbo, thats my Princi Award!	Quiet, Principal Spinner.
Theyre just not responding to logic anymore. Ill never win this alone. Theres only one guy who can help me now.	Look, Im throwing papers.
Bart, if theres one thing Im good at, its pretending things didnt happen. And I think this is one of those.	One of which?
Exactly.	No, seriously, I wasnt listening.
One of those situations where...	Gotcha!
Seems like animated shows are everywhere. Or were, last year.	Cool, Japanimation.
Your laugh is incorrect, Meganaut! Activate Prawn Power!	Man, that Princess Tempura is one heck of a Transformazoid.
Wait, Im confused. Why was a wolf shooting a web?	Cartoons dont have to make sense.
Uh... lemme see... Ill make him an offer he cant refuse. And thats the truth.	That dogs a riot.
It is!	I dont believe it. Say something else smart.
Im gonna wear my apron on the Fourth of July.	And this lead apron will keep me safe downstairs.
Yee-ha!	Go, bull! Toss his salad!
Hey, wheres your blue shirt?	I dont have a blue shirt.
They are coming back for us, arent they?	Iunno.
Terrific. Bart, Sideshow Bob says hell be seeing you real soon.	That Bob.
Scary talented. And Im gonna make sure the parole board knows it.	You gonna bribe em?
I might grease the wheels of justice with some cookies.	Oh, can I have some?
Ow! Owww, my back. Dr. Steve didnt do anything.	Did you do those exercises he gave you?
Dad!	Are you okay?
I feel fantastic!	That trash can must have unkinked your back.
Not trash can, son. Dr. Homers Miracle Spine-O-Cylinder! Patent pending.	Okay, okay.
Jack Crowley.	Man, is that wimpy!
Crowleys an ex-con?! Dear Lord, Ive peed in front of him!	Hey, check it out!
I dont know. It came with the house.	Hey Dad, bet you five bucks you cant eat the whole box.
Uh-oh. Dads having an antacid trip.	And I won fifty bucks!
Can I see the fifty, Bart? Can I? Huh?	Milhouse, my friend, you and I are going on a spending spree.
My doctor says Im not supposed to go on sprees.	What about jags?
Jags are fine.	Wonderful.
Our wide variety of gum comes in both stick and ball.	Im not really about gum. But I like the whole chewing thing...
Are you averse to crispy centers, sir?	Not at all.
Then we have much to discuss.	Too much raw bacon.
My mom doesnt believe in fabric softener. But shes not around!	Im picking the next thing.
Yes, you are quite correct to gasp. Also, note the price twenty-five dollars.	We had to buy lunch for that homeless guy.
Sold.	Dont do it, lady. That stuffs worth thousands.
Yes, it says here hes the movie magician behind Creepshow, Friday the 13th and Dawn of the Dead.	I cant believe Im gonna miss that!
Dont worry your spiky little head. Ive got it all planned out.	How could you have it planned out? You just heard about the problem.
Mister Simpson, it hurts!	Yeah. And why did we have to do this all the way from home?
Oh, we missed the gutbuster!	Yeah. That should be us covered with blood!
You saved my life?	Yeah. After you were so mean to us.
Can you believe it, Bart? Were actually running a comic book store.	Looks like our lifetime ban just expired.
Looks like our lifetime ban just expired.	Sorry, sorry.
Okay, heres Comic Book Guys instructions A carton of malted milk balls, one box confectioners sugar, a can of chocolate frosting...	Thats just his shopping list.
No, its his instructions.	Well, were gonna make some changes around here. This stores gonna be run by kids and for kids.
Well, were gonna make some changes around here. This stores gonna be run by kids and for kids.	Ah, nice to see ya... Hey, how bout that Bloodzilla? Vampire Dinosaur, ohh, you cant make that stuff up...
The Death of Sad Sack. This better not be another fake-out.	Uh-uh, you gotta be forty inches tall for the adult section.
Pleeeease?	Okay, but get on your tippy-toes.
Hey Bart, I finished organizing the stock room.	Mark down the Poochie crap. And then unstick all the Supergirls.
You know, if were partners, maybe you should do some of the work.	Less barking, more marking.
It doesnt even smack good.	How could you spend all our money on a comic published by Lens Crafters?
How could you spend all our money on a comic published by Lens Crafters?	Well never sell these. Birds wont even use them in their nests.
Okay, so I made one bad decision.	Its my fault for leaving you in charge. Sometimes I forget how young you are.
Im only three months younger than you.	Oh, look, youre gettin cranky. You havent had your juice.
Well, my straw broke off in the carton. Thats not the point! Were supposed to be partners, and youre pushing me around like a Playskool Corn Popper.	Its a vacuum cleaner, Milhouse.
Whatever. I demand respect! I have feelings! Im a human boy, just like you!	Shhhh. Use your indoor voice.
Aieeeeeee!	En garde!
Eat watering can, partner!	Whoa...
Comic Book Guys secret stash!	Look at all these bootleg videos! Alien Autopsy Illegal Alien Autopsy, Godfather III -- Good Version...
Well, in that case... My neighbor Homer released a radioactive ape in my house. Its ah, its taken over the whole top floor.	It wasnt dads fault. The ape tricked him. Whats next?
You know, Ill bet kids would pay to see this stuff. We could have a midnight screening right here in the store.	Thats actually a great idea, Milhouse.
Really? Well, I was due.	Ill say... Partner.
If you are watching this tape, you are the President of the United States. Hello Sir, or Maam... hopefully Sir.	Got that right.
Well, we may not have the store, but at least were friends again.	Yep. And we havent been to school in days and days and days.
Stop that! And get ready! Were going to the old folks talent show. Now get washed up.	With pleasure.
Hes heading into Dead Mans Curve!	Hey, get me outta here! Hey!
Thats tennis?! Then whats the one where the chicks whale on each other?	Foxy boxing?
Get off my property.	...so from now on, all hats are banned from the school.
Hey there, son!	Oh. Hi Dad.
With that little outfit on, everyones gonna think youre playing in the tournament.	I am playing in the tournament.
Its gonna be tough without a partner.	Ive got a partner.
Well, good for you! Anyone I know?	Yeah, you know her.
No. No, no, no. Youre my partner.	Dude, I think the ladys made her decision.
I dont think they saw me.	Im gonna put my trophy on the mantle. How bout you?
My manhood? I never thought of that!	We were good, Dad. They asked us to play in the Krusty Klassic!
Its for charity -- it benefits victims of balcony collapse.	We can wipe out B.C. in our lifetime.
Darling, youre so much handsomer than my first husband.	I may have the looks, but hes the trophy husband.
I may have the looks, but hes the trophy husband.	He thought that trip to the guillotine factory was just for fun. But it was the perfect place to shoot him.
Hey, leave my teammate alone!	Lisas your teammate?
Dont listen. Its a trick!	Dear Lisa. Psych. Psych, psych, psych. Signed, Super-psych.
I just ate a personal pizza.	Youre dumping me.
Which one am I? Serena or Venus?	Youre Andre. Im Serena.
You know, theres a lesson here for all of us its better to watch stuff than to do stuff.	Amen.
Whats on TV?	Nutsy the clown.
And finally, Bart Simpson should immediately proceed, unescorted, to the old sports equipment shed behind the school.	Ha. So long, suckers!
Hello, Bart.	Oh, its you, Bob. How ya doin?
No screams? Not even an eep?	Hey, Im not afraid of you. Every time we tangle, you wind up in jail. Im 6 and 0.
Rakes. My old arch-enemy.	I thought I was your arch-enemy.
Oh, believe me, I have a plan. Lets see... Get job as school announcer...lure Bart to shed...secure same to chair with rope... Ah, here we are. Have Bart kill Krusty.	Krusty?! Thats the one man I would never kill.
I needed that for laundry!	Hey, stupid.
Hey, stupid.	You looked!
You are in my power!	I am at your command.
I didnt say anything about command. If youre in my power, say so.	I am in your power.
Look! Krusty invited us to the taping of his last episode.	Hello, family.
Where have you been, young man? Its nearly bedtime.	I was... I was...
If anyone asks, you were at the flower shop.	I was at the flower shop.
Good evening, folks. And welcome to my final clown-cast. The word legend has many definitions...	This is for Sideshow Bob.
Its time, Bart. Time to blow up the clown.	Time to blow up the clown...
You will run up and hug him -- blowing each of you to smithereens!	What-ever.
Oh, please. You get exhausted watching The Twilight Zone marathon! Im a regular Billy Crystal.	You got that right.
And with five hundred yards to go, the runners from Australia and Djibouti are neck and neck. Two weary warriors now, burning with pain and exhaustion. But only one will win the grand prize... A walking tour of Springfield.	That tour is mine.
Hes running on sheer pluck, moxie, and grit... All of which hell be tested for, after the race.	Eh, I winna da race! Viva Italia!
Folks, our winner seems to be from Italy.	I love-a you all!
I love-a you all!	I use up all-a my English.
Get in! Hurry!	Mob... Stranger. Mob... Stranger. Stranger.
Oh, youll find out in due time.	Well, it says here your name is L.T. Smash.
Now hold on. I have some concerns.	Please, Mom. My dream is to be a rock star.
Next, hell break your nose, your glasses and your heart... Nelson!	Wait, these are just guys from school. Whos next? Ralph Wiggum?
All thats left is the singing.	PARTY POSSE, WE RULE THE EARTH / THE GREATEST BAND SINCE MUSICS BIRTH.
PARTY POSSE, WE RULE THE EARTH / THE GREATEST BAND SINCE MUSICS BIRTH.	Isnt this song a little boastful?
Silence! Here they are, the Party Posse!	Hel-lo, Springfield! Now, heres a song that your Principal Skinner doesnt want us to play.
Thats not true! This assembly was my idea. I like your brand of inoffensive pop rock.	Screw you, man! Were gonna play it anyway!
Screw you, man! Were gonna play it anyway!	I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT AT THE SPELLING BEE...
She lives with me.	I cant believe it. They loved us!
We saw your Band Formation Notice in the paper.	Really? You saw our B.F.N.?
Stubble glitter... crowd taser...	Crowd taser?

Everybody ball-walk!	Oh, yeah.
So, ah, what songs did I miss?	Dad, L.T.s gone crazy!
Yeah, thats the look.	Think hes gonna do something dangerous?
We gotta mellow him out.	But how? We would need the ultimate chill-out song.
I wanna twirl.	Aw, come on, guys, weve only got a few minutes...
Aw, come on, guys, weve only got a few minutes...	Uh-oh...
Well, boys, the Party Posse is over, but at least I saved you from a public spoofing.	Aw, man, we could have been on the cover of MAD.
But... the TV gave me the impression that...	We said meh.
Dont you mean Blocko shirt?	Right, right. Blocko shirt.
Well, youre welcome, honey. Now, Im gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. Got a problem, Bart?	A girl at school wont go to the dance with me.
Barts got a girlfriend!	No I dont, thats the problem.
Oh, my head. How long have I been out here?	All night. You were yelling at the swing.
I was? But I love the swing.	Dad, you were nuts.
Dont worry. Duffs not gonna let me waste away to nothing.	Uh, Dad?
Theres still more meatloaf.	Ohh, thats impossible.
You can spit on the bus.	Uh, Mom...
Oh, its tough being the new kid. Someone should go talk to her.	Yeah, somebody should. One-hour dry cleaner. Man, thats fast.
Olive oil? Asparagus? If your mother wasnt so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people.	I need this candy for school.
I need this candy for school.	Candy Class.
In the cart.	Im out of wine.
My doctor says, and my garage mechanic agrees, that...	In the cart.
Yknow, I always felt sorry for Marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun.	Yeah. I wish Maggie had to go to the emergency room more often.
Most of it was sent by relatives who couldnt see very well.	Hey, I found some eggs! The mother abandoned her nest.
Ow! What the hell?	Whoa, a solid gold animal cracker.
Hey, you didnt see a warthog!	Im looking at one right now.
Nobodys a warthog.	What about him?
Look what Mbali gave me.	Hey, check it out.
Bart, I told you not to get your lip disked.	All right.
All right.	Uh-oh-boh-boh.
Shaka Zulu!	Which way should we go?
Not a chance.	Wow, Dad. How did you do that?
I told you, yes. Now Bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel.	Mount Kilimanjaro?
Go.	Okay.
Hello, little fella.	Hey, maybe itll lead us to bananas.
Its kind of you to take us in, Dr. Bushwell.	Yeah, thanks for the grub.
Grubs.	Whatever.
Whatever.	Ah, theres a burst of flavor.
So like us...	Yes!
How could you exploit your beloved chimps like this?	I think we should look at her research before we condemn her entirely.
I think we should look at her research before we condemn her entirely.	I havent said anything for a while.
Very nice.	Hey, Lis, check it out.
Hey, Lis, check it out.	Diamond Vision.
They also make Juice-lix.	Thats Milhouse.
Thats Milhouse.	And it sounds like he has big news!
Breakfast!	Thats Milhouse.
Thats Milhouse.	And it sounds like he has big news!
Lazy, huh? Get im, boys.	Okay, okay.
Breakfast!	Thats Milhouse.
Thats Milhouse.	And it sounds like he has big news!
I found something awesome in the woods.	Is it a dead body?
Its cooler than a million dead bodies.	You take my sisters bike.
You take my sisters bike.	Lets see, front door, back door, Skinners, Flanders, your house... ah, Lisas bike.
Its disturbingly comfortable.	Whoa. Howd you find it?
This is where I come to cry.	Cool.
It gets better. Theyre full of fireworks.	Bottle rockets, Frog-Launchers, Weeping Mommas... Tijuana Toilet Crackers!
Were not ready!	Uh-oh.
We gotta hide.	Well be safe in here!
Your mission is to find the fireworks smugglers and get them to say something incriminating on this tape.	Hootie and the Blowfish?
So much paperwork.	Knock, knock.
Knock, knock.	Excuse me, my friend and I were interested in purchasing quality fireworks.
Surprise me.	Milhouse, quick!
Oh, dont you worry. Well make all the hard decisions so you dont have to.	We can take whatever we want, right?
Dont throw this away. Its Rods first tooth.	Youre right. We could use this for witchcraft.
Man, this is taking forever. I know how to speed things up.	Her pillows stuck.
Yeah, just a little shocked. Whats that? Some kinda sorting machine?	Kinda.
What? That doesnt sound like me.	Hey, Dad, something didnt get, um, sorted.
But where do you put something that big?	You could fix up the old Storytime Village. Theyve been out of business ever since that kid got his head cut off.
Youre doing that the sucker way. Try a little vitamin G.	Are you nuts?
But it wasnt clouds and angels playing harps like at the end of so many Three Stooges shorts. It was a golden elementary school, with a teachers lounge that stretched as far as the eye could see. And no one was ever tardy.	Was I there?
Im sorry, the ticket price doesnt cover visions, miracles, or other Godly hoo-hah.	Yeah, folks, the power of Christ compels you to give Ned an extra ten bucks.
For me, dis is hell. Ya dig, pally?	Whos next?
Why wont you light? The gas is on full blast!	You better stick your head in and see whats going on.
Yo, boy. This class is tight. You go from sloppa to proppa.	Cool!
Welcome to my etiquette class The Proper Young Man.	But the black man said...
Well, I can still hang out with you guys.	Sorry, Ive got a baseball game in fifteen minutes.
Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo!	Dads been doing that for two hours!
I cant remember the last time Dad sang us a torch song.	Yeah. Hey, Homer, I thought you were only gonna do this day care thing till your knee was better.
You have the bestest Dad. He read me a story about Chinese food.	You havent seen the real Homer. Its all burping and neglect.
I think we know your Dad a little bit better than you do, Bart.	Is that my jacket?
Theyre always laughing. Laughing at nothing.	How come parents are always nicer to other kids than they are to their own?
I guess Dad just takes us for granted.	Well, dont worry. Thisll give his heartstrings a much needed plucking.
Well, if you want, you can sit on this.	Teamsters are sleeping in my room.
Cause the thing is, there are no bad kids...	Ow! You stepped on my arm!
Night will come soon.	Theres gotta be a way to get back at Dad.
Well, Ive been cutting the felt kinda crooked.	No. Weve gotta show the world what Dads really like. Then everything will be back to normal.
I guess you could sum up Homer in two words...	Big phony!
Big phony!	This is the real Homer Simpson -- a beer-drinking meanie!
I wanna see Wilmington!	I wanna visit a screen door factory!
The Simpsons are ridin the rails!	Cool. A dead hobo.
They dont want me anymore.	Hey, I found a bullet.
I can see you know babies.	Hey, a fortune teller.
Good idea, Mr. Ed. Wanna come along, Noodle Neck?	Cant live this way... anymore.
Yeah, could I be any more of a house?	Eh. Who else we got?
Murder-suicides.	Hey, how bout 007?!
Say, its a bit stuffy in here. And I know a certain someone who really fancies lilac.	I just like it, is all.
Soyghetti-Os!	Hey Pierce, howd you know our favorite foods?
Well Bart, did you study your spell book last night? Or did your fairy godmother die again?	I studied! Abraca-turn-into-a-prince-guy?
Please kill me!	You think youre so great just because you have God-like powers.
Stand away from milady.	Get in there. Defend my honor!
Welcome to my lair. Youre going to help me.	And if I dont?
Anyway, how would you like to humiliate your sister?	Id like that. Id like that very much.
Now, it would involve betrayal and unspeakable evil...	Hey, hey, you made your sale.
Tonight shell perform the classic Levitating Dragon trick.	Well see about that.
This is partly my fault.	Prank be undone! Destroy the evil one!
Prank be undone! Destroy the evil one!	Not me...
Help me, Bart!	Aiyeeee!
Oh, sir! In death we shall be together always.	Ew.
Bart, lets stop this stupid rivalry. Even if you never become a great sorcerer, youre still an okay brother.	Thanks, Lis. Now lets try to forget this nightmare.
WONT YOU MARRY ME, BI-ILL? / I GOT THE WEDDING GOWN BI-ILL / CAUSE WEDDINGS ARE NI-ICE...	Lets never miss the school bus again.
If were late for school, well miss our free federal breakfast!	Big deal. Its just saltines and fig paste.
Hey, check it out. Wiggums cruiser.	Wow, tear gas, riot club, police hat...
...with rain baggie!	Ah, man, that would really keep your head dry.
Have you ever been in a police car?	Not in the front.
Hey, I just had this crazy idea.	Really? What?
Whats this thing? Miranda Rights Teleprompter?	Check this out!
Check this out!	You, there. Put your hands up.
Me? Okay.	Now, drop your pants.
Yeah, b-but my hands are up.	Hula out of them.
Its me, Clancy.	No! Get away!
No! Get away!	Uh-oh.
Well, you look like a good student, well with those glasses... and I suppose boys will be boys... Case dismissed.	Good ol Judge Snyder.
Next defendant, Bartholomew J. Simpson.	Well, its showtime.
Why, hello, Bart. Say, are those new shoes?	Yes they are, Roy.
Oh my! Looks like you were the ringleader in this car theft. And thats a felony.	Yes, sir.
Grand theft auto?!	It was an accident, maam.
And unusual.	Can that judge do this to us?
Can that judge do this to us?	Mom, you cut the tether.
...honey. You know, this could be fun. Race you to the kitchen, my little tether ball.	Youre on, Rope-a-dope!
Whats wrong with him now, Bart?	Night terrors, maam.
Run, Bart! Pump your thighs! Pump them...	Hurry up, Dad!
Safe!	Wow, my first home run.
I thought I would hate working nights. But its so peaceful. And theres no one here to squeal on me for shootin mice.	Can I ask you something, Dad?
Sure, boy.	The town keeps getting bigger. Will there always be enough electricity?
Oh, son. You know thats none of your business. Say, is that our house?	Uh, I dont think Lennys house has a steeple.
Really. You like skateboards? Were sure learning a lot about each other.	Yeah, this tether has some pluses.
Thats my little slugger.	Cmon, Dad. Lets go.
Well, thats a pretty big if, honey.	Cmon, Dad. I gotta go to the bathroom.
No! I dont want you going in a bottle. Thats what hobos do.	Come on, Homer.
No!	Mo-om!
But...	The lady said no.
Hey, shut up.	You shut up.
Ow! Why you--!	Whatd you do that for?
Because I... Ow! You--!	Ah!
Its a miracle poor Bartholomew isnt robbing banks and chasing Sweet Lady H.	Im a latchkey kid.
Do you think its fair that youre always getting into trouble, yet Mom and Dad are being punished?	No, its terrible.
Well, why dont you do something about it?	After wrestling.
When are you gonna start taking responsibility for your actions?	Cuz I felt like it.
Youre not even listening!	I know you are, but what am I?
Shut up. You two are not only horrible parents, youre violent criminals. And Im gonna lock you up till frogs do fractions.	Your Honor! May I say something?
Well, it is highly unorthodox... so no.	Please, your Honor?
Oh, I cant resist that look. You remind me of me, when I was a little boy.	Your Honor, its not easy being my parents. Im always screwing up in school, and getting in trouble with the law. But if I grow up to be a halfway decent person, I know itll be because of my Mom and Dad.
Your Honor, its not easy being my parents. Im always screwing up in school, and getting in trouble with the law. But if I grow up to be a halfway decent person, I know itll be because of my Mom and Dad.	Everyone else might give up on me, but my parents never will.
Um, did she say she used to be a dude?	So, your honor, if youre going to punish anyone in this courtroom today, I ask that you punish me.
What are you doing?	Diggin.
Why?	Make a hole.
A hole for what?	More diggin.
Oh hello, young man. Beautiful day for digging, isnt it?	Yep.
Yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?	Nuh-uh.
So, I guess you wouldnt mind if I was to dig a hole of my own.	Go for it.
Maybe I will.	Whats stopping you?
Call me Bob. Well, thats quite a hole youre digging.	Thanks, Bob.
You know, a holes a great place to hide when people are fighting. Are there angry people in your house?	My dads always yelling that whiteys keepin him down.
You keep digging like this, youre gonna go straight through to China.	If it happens, it happens.
Yello?	Yeah, Id like to speak to a Mr. Tabooger. First name, Ollie.
Ooo, Bart! My first prank call. What do I do?	Just ask if anyone knows Ollie Tabooger.
I dont get it.	Yell out Ill eat a booger.
Whats the gag?	Oh, forget it.
Freshen your drink, pal?	Just leave the bottle.
Its a snap when you use Certified Contractors.	Like the ones found in your local Yellow Pages.
Tofu and gluten!	Im thankful I ate before I came.
Im absolutely evil!	Youre preachin to the choir, man.
I think it can.	Are you talking about a soul patch?
Oh, Homey, you poor thing.	Whoa, cool, hes still mental!
You know, if Dad never told anyone, that body must still be out there.	This sounds like a case that only the Simpson family can solve.
Someones yellow belly is showing.	Oh, sorry.
Whos there? How do you... How do you know my name?!	Its us, the Simpsons.
Aw, dont get excited. Its just a skull-shaped rock and a buncha white sticks.	Its the body!
Did I say corpse-hatch? I meant innocence tube.	Then how do you explain this?
Why are these numbers so high? Why is that red light flashing?	Who cares?
Smithers Jr.!	Ha, busted!
Thats just a dog in a space suit.	From the looks of it, a male dog.
Hi, Im Colonel Chet Manners, five-time space shuttle alternate.	Lo-ser.
Do you want to boldly go where people like me, but not me, have gone before? Then get the Orbit King -- with yaw control like youve never seen!	Hey Lis, is Dads credit card number 5784365343410709?
WHEN YOU HAVE A RIB-EYE STEAK / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / OH, THAT MEATLOAF TASTED GREAT / YOU MUST FLOSS IT / NOW FLOSS IT, FLOSS IT GOOD.	Hey Dad, will you help me build this model rocket?
Science!?	Uh, he didnt say science... he said pie pants.
My eyebrows. My beautiful eyebrows!	Over here, Guvnor.
Now all we need is our astronaut. Bart, wheres Americas newest hero?	Hes saying goodbye to his wife.
Oh, hes leaving her with five babies.	She already ate three.
Do a nice one for Grandma.	Fine.
Yep.	Hey, how bout one of those religions where you eat a human heart?
No.	How bout Methodist?
No! Look, Im not just gonna pick a religion that seems cool. Im gonna pick one thats right for me.	How bout Judaism? When you turn thirteen, cha-ching.
So, you think you know better than this family, huh. Well, as long as youre in my house, youll do what I do and believe what I believe. So butter your bacon!	Yes, father.
Hold that thought. Bacon up that sausage, boy.	But Dad, my heart hurts.
His names Gunnar and hes datin my Mom. Sometimes he buys us beer.	I thought Kearney was dating your Mom.
Hm. Its a pity.	All right! Trash cookies!
All right! Trash cookies!	Uh-oh. I think I ate a dog food lid.
Here she comes! And-a one and-a two and-a...	WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS / WE WISH...
We were looking for Lisa!	I thought we were caroling.
New shooter.	Thats it, baby. Welcome to Marvin Gardens.
Im good for the rest, you know I am.	Well, Id like to trust you, Homer. But youve been in jail three times.
Oh sure, you take his side. Just cause he bought you that house on St. James Place.	Who else is gonna take care of her? Dad?
I am Brenda. I am programmed to talk in a calm and constructive manner. Destroy! Destroy!	Hey, this is taffy!
Thanks a lot, everybody. Now Ill never get into an Ivy League school.	Youre going to Stanford! Youre going to Stanford!
Youre going to Stanford! Youre going to Stanford!	Youre going to Stanford.
Well, my room is my sanctuary. My family knows that and respects that.	I got sprayed by a skunk! Let me rub it off on your sweaters.
And Bart, youll do anything for attention -- cut that out!	They chose me.
Good. I hung it on the top of that tree.	But how are we supposed to get it?
My driving ankle! Bart, I know this sounds crazy, but do you think you can drive the car?	Okay, but its my first time.
Heres the keys.	I got a set.
WE ARE FAMILY!	OUR BITTER FIGHTS ARE NOW HISTORY!
You could look seven. And I could teach you to count cards.	Eh, I already got a system.
I would if it wasnt for the kids.	Hey, the heart wants what it wants, dude.
Woo hoo!	You crapped out, Vegas Mom.
Oh my God! Wow. Now thats a goiter.	Why would Duff Beer put out a book?
Ive used up all these records.	Why dont you try to set a record, Dad?
I dont know how this town got so fat.	Mom, were out of Frosting Gobs.
Oh yeah, like Erin Brockovich.	The prostitute with a heart of gold.
Hows he doing?	I think hes grossed-out by some seaweed.
Remember what I told you about running away from your troubles?	Yeah.
Indeed, Marge. And, uh, now that I think of it, I wildly exceeded my authority. And I declare the sugar ban over!	Can we, Mom? Can we? Please, please, please?
Maybe we should try to calm Dad down.	I prefer to egg him on. Hey Dad, has the movie started yet?
Uh-oh.	Hey, Dad. Im gonna make a human yo-yo. If you object, clearly say no.
Whats going on?	Were rehearsing a play.
Oh, what do I do? What do I do?	Wait, I know. Beer here!
Oh Homer, save me, save me!	He saved her! Oh. Isnt it great to have the old Dad back?
I thought you liked the new Dad.	Whatever.
That sounds great.	Cool, Moms on drugs. If we turn her in we get a form letter from Dick Cheney!
For you. For you.	Ooooh.
Hey, a helicopters landing on our lawn!	Lets approach with caution!
Thank you, youve been very helpful.	Dad just got a library card in West Springfield. He checked out ten books on oil rigging and a book called Dying for Dummies.
No. The Olympics have preempted my favorite shows for the last time!	You can always find your favorite shows next month.
You were so brave to take on all those bullies.	Those werent bullies. Thats a bully.
Time to go, Greta. Your mothers custody starts at eighteen hundred hours.	Your Dads McBain?
Come. We play Uno, I chase you with hose -- no biggie.	Wow, cool! Uh, I guess were leaving, too.
Bart, your little tie makes me smile.	Excuse me, but you dont sound as tough as you do in the movies.
These are props from one of my Dads movies -- The Incredible Shrinking McBain.	Wow! The Q-tip he used to kill Ross Perot! Ho-ho, everything in your house is so cool.
Whats your house like?	Oh, its okay. My bed is stuffed with hay.
Bart, youre so funny.	Yeah.
Yeah, one time, she-- Oh, shes looking at us. Be cool.	What are you doing?
What are you doing?	Ohh, I got ya.
Ohh, I got ya.	One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war.
One, two, three.	Hey, that was a fast count!
Oh, you brought someone.	Yeah, this is Milhouse. Hes my best friend, because ... well, geographical convenience really.
Do you promise?	Just go.
Bart, my schools having a dance. Its, its pretty lame, but maybe you could make it fun... if we went together.	Yeah, I guess.
Now. Ill give you directions, starting from the Simpsons house...	Oh-ho, we are so there.
Arent you supposed to take Greta to the dance tonight?	Oh, yeah. Maybe I should keep my promise.
I just hope the audience is kind because my material is weak and, uh, and I have that bladder thing.	Thats it. Im blowing off the dance. This is the biggest thing thats happened to me since chocolate milk.
So, its, uh, standardized testing time again. Have you ever noticed how the dumb kids fill in the wrong circles?	Sey-mour...
Sey-mour...	Sey-mour...
Lost my place. Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe a little, uh, improv would raise the roof, here. Would someone name a profession?	Loser principal!
Greta called. It seems you told her you were sick.	Lisa, I only lied because it was the easiest way to get what I wanted.
Bart, this girl is in love with you. Think about it.	Hey, I didnt lead her on. I always played it light and breezy.
Well, if you dont feel the way Greta does, youve got to tell her before she gets hurt.	All right, I know what to do. Ill dump her like shes never been dumped before, then well go right back to being friends.
Well Bart, you really understand women.	Lis, women are easy. State capitals are hard.
Whazzup?!	Milhouse? Greta? Well, no one has to draw me a picture.
Oh, but I did.	Greta, is this how it is?
Oh, Bart, its human nature. You only want her because someone else has her.	Prove it. Using examples from this room.
See?	Gimme the ball! Gimme the ball!
Leave a message at the beep. But dont be a message monster, hogging all my tape.	Uh, Greta, its me. I think you left your pencil over at my house and hes there now, isnt he?
Uh, Greta, its me. I think you left your pencil over at my house and hes there now, isnt he?	I knew it. Youre there. Just hear me out.
Bart, forget it. Im leaving in ten minutes. My Dads shooting a movie in Toronto.	Youre going to Spain?!
Goodbye, Bart.	...so to win Greta back, I have to go to Toronto.
Canada? Why should we leave America to visit America Junior?	This is for love, Dad. Someday youll feel what I feel.
Its so clean and bland. Im home!	Wow, this bus station is the birthplace of Paul Shaffer.
No, maam. Im drunk.	There it is -- Wolfcastles movie set.
There she is, boy.	I dont know, Dad. What if shes still mad at me?
Listen to me, son. No one loves a quitter. So you go over there and you win her back.	But she might say no.
Youre not gonna win her back. Shes with the House now.	Milhouse, shes only dating you to get back at me.
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Both our viewers must be thrilled!	Greta, I miss you so much. Please be my girlfriend again.
Sorry, guys. But you two have put me off dating for at least four years. I think Ill just buckle down and co-produce my Dads movies.	Need a unit production manager?
I cant believe I have to give her half my stuff. But are we still friends?	Til the next one. So whatll we do now?
Well, were in Canada. Lets find something fun!	Ive got just the ticket. Come on.
I cant believe were on the Canadian Olympic basketball team.	Yep. Its just that easy.
Aha! A free baseball.	A shiny new dime!
A shiny new dime!	A shinier new dime!
Excuse me, my refrigeration unit is broken. Could you possibly eat some free ice cream?	What flavor?
Why, super chocolate, of course. Oh yes.	This day just keeps getting better and better.
This day just keeps getting better and better.	And heres a new four-legged friend for me. Hiya boy. Havent seen you around here before.
Oh, right.	A crazy dogs trying to kill me!
Hurry up, Bart, or youll be late to be killed by the dog.	What?
This ones from Gunfight at the Museum of Natural History.	You were in movies?
Hold onto your hat, son. Youre talkin to Buck McCoy.	Who?
Yeah, thats right. Buck McCoy. The most famous movie cowboy in the world.	No kiddin. Anyway, I climbed over your gate. A dog was after me.
Ill show you a trick that you can use on dogs. Also worked on David O. Selznick.	Who?
Yeah, thats right. The David O. Selznick.	Keep him away from me.
Now, lean down and put your arms across his neck.	Whoa, it worked!
Whoa, it worked!	Where did you learn that?
Ah, you pick things up. Do you know how to catch a wild boar with a teaspoon?	No.
Well what do you kids do all day?	Well, right now, Im supposed to be in school.
Why thank you! Most people just mutter that.	Is that horse vacuuming?
And he got the film by credit.	Five oclock? I better get home for dinner.
Hi, honey. Wheres that vicious dog? I made him a biscuit.	Oh, hes not bothering me any more. Buck McCoy helped me.
Junior Buckaroo 2nd Class. Little Grampa Simpson.	Cool.
They were pictures that the whole family could enjoy. No drugs, no nudity, no cussin. Just drinkin, fightin and trippin horses with wires.	Whats this lunchbox made of?
Well back in my day we had a thing called metal. Everything was made of it. Lunchboxes, cars, you name it.	Met-tal. Hey, can you still do cowboy tricks?
Heres one I did in The Wild Lunch.	Everything tastes better when its lassoed.
Hey boy, whered you get that hat?	Buck gave it to me. Hes just about the greatest guy who ever lived. I wanna grow up to be just like him.
No kidding? Hey, speaking of achievers, theyre thinking of spraying your old mans work space for ticks.	Thats great, champ. I know youve been wantin that. Well, gotta mosey. Homer. Maam.
Swell.	I cant wait till I get good.
I cant wait till I get good.	Bucks here!
Bucks here!	Dad, why are you wearing that?
They wrote me out of the show and it became Room 222.	So thats how you ended your career?
Well, I think westerns are due for a comeback.	Yeah, we can have showdowns at the schoolyard and use nerds as Indians!
Bart, you look so cool.	I was thinkin this could be A new fad.
Hey, youre not fun, youre fat.	Now, listen up. When I come back tomorrow youd better have cowboy suits. And theyd better be adorable.
Whos the first one again?	Buck McCoy.
Oh, good, you worked in Judge Ito.	Please put Buck on. Hes my hero.
Listen, missy. The last two city-slickers who used reverse psychology on me are pushing up daisies.	Theyre dead?
Oh, like youre so perfect with your plastic mane and your painted-on spot. Whats real on you? Nothin!	Hes drunk!
These hilarious health professionals will cut me out of my clothes after this commercial.	What happened, Buck?
Well, I thought if you were looking to worship someone, maybe it could be your old man?	Eh, we could try it.
You dont need that.	Way to go, Buck. I feel my faith growing anew.
Arent you forgettin someone?	Well, theres Krusty, Itchy, Scratchy, Poochie, Americas firefighters and then you, Dad.
Im really gonna miss him.	Its Grampas smell. Old Old Spice.
Yeah, its the only way to win back Zelda. And if I go to prison, Ill get better food and more hugs.	Uh, its actually blue wire to yellow wire.
Next stop, Branson, Missoura.	Can I tag along?
During the war, Eleanor Roosevelt was the voice of Scratchy.	The lady knows funny.
Okay, keep an eye peeled for Zelda.	Is that her?
No.	Is that her?
No.	Is that her?
No.	Is that her?
Lets take a quick gambling break. A little action will really sharpen our senses.	All gone.
Grampa, look over there.	Its Captain Bringdown and the Buzzkillers. If youre gonna make your move, you better do it quick.
Oh yeah, I checked that out when Bart was born. I was gonna read to him every day.	What happened?
That mini-van had the biggest cup holders. And change slots for every coin, from penny to quarter!	Dad, I loved it, too, but it was seven years ago.
Its been so many years since Ive seen your father. I hope hes still the magnificent physical specimen he was when he left.	Mom, maybe its time to choose a suitor.
Discus Stu has Ouzo for twozo.	Ill leave you guys alone.
Son, hows it going with the breakfast pÃ¢tÃ©?	Im on it.
Bartrand, where is your sister Joan? Morning bells are ringing. Morning bells are ringing!	Shes talking to her invisible friend. God.
God spoke to me -- I must obey.	Joan, give me your dessert.
Our next story is Hamlet, by William Shakespeare.	Dad, these old stories cant compare with our modern super-writers. Stephen Bochco could kick Shakespeares ass.
Look, this story is more interesting than you think. It starts with Hamlets father getting murdered.	Cool. Does he get to marry his Mom?
Iunno. Surprise me! Surprise me!	Could that fat ghost be telling the truth? First Ive got to get Uncle Claudius to confess, then Ive gotta kill him.
And thats the greatest thing ever written.	Are you crazy? I cant believe a play where every character was murdered could be so boring.
Now thats what I call a moon shot.	Dad, that line was in the cartoon.
Boy, did you make a prank call to Brazil?	No sir, I didnt.
Uh, I think were with Comquaaq.	No, I think its Niagular.
Homer, what are you going to do?	Crazy scheme, crazy scheme, crazy scheme...
Get me tools and beer.	Yes!
How did I get here?	We found you smoldering in the bushes.
Then its settled. The Simpsons are going to Brazil.	Then Ill have been on every continent.
Woo hoo!	Get ready, Brazil. I now speak fluent Spanish.
Well done Bart, but in Brazil they speak Portuguese.	Ay caramba, que mujer tonta! Veinte horas estudiar por nada!
Bart, what are you watching?	Kids show.
Bert and Ernie left it to your imagination.	Look, the room came with a fruit hat.
Hey, and a mini-bar hat.	IM CHIQUITA BANANA / AND IM HERE TO SAY...
Works for me.	Yeah, check out the rats.
Ah yes, Ronaldo. He went out months ago and we havent heard from him since. Every day we light a candle for him.	Have you tried looking for him?
There is a dress code on this beach. But we can help you.	I feel so European.
Ahhh...	Theres gotta be a million kids here. Well never find Ronaldo.
Ronaldo?!	You know him?
Hey, Bart. How many more places do we have to search?	Just one, and its across town.
Eh, same old garbage!	This guys always on!
All right. Ill do it for my kids.	As long as youre doin things for me, would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house.
Its time for your surprise, Dad.	Yeah. Hop in, Homer.
Whos Mark Spitz?	Whats a telegram?
Aw, forget it. I gotta get to the hot wings before the Comic Book Guy.	You know, Lisa, they say father knows best.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And now humanity must be judged. The fate of your planet rests on one human being... Homer Simpson.	Why him?
Michigan.	Why does Danger Dog mean more to me than school or church?
Im called Ralph.	Mine is Danger Dude. But hes a dog.
Mine is Danger Dude. But hes a dog.	Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.	Well, Im my own toughest critic, but I think its genius. Now to sell it for millions.
Oh, well-- Stan Lee?!	Creator of Marvel Comics?!
My Spidey sense is tingling!	Its that good?
Whoa. Did I say Spidey? I meant Stinky. Nuff said.	What did I do wrong?
Now hold on, Comic Book Guy. This boys still finding his voice.	So youre saying I should keep trying?
I just need one great idea...	Batman!... oh, its been done.
Batman!... oh, its been done.	Green Lantern!... nah.
I like Little Dot. Could you rip that off? I mean, whos gonna know?	Id know, mom.
Hm, that little girl sure loved dots.	Hm, all I need is one classic character...
Ow!	Hey...
My ice cream sandwich! Then where the hells the remote?!	Whats it to ya?
Why do people keep moving it... stupid...	Oh, this is perfect.
Oh, this is perfect.	A couple of stink lines around his butt... and Im done.
Simpson, youve created a timeless comic character.	Thanks guys.
Bart, this is just Dad!	Uh, its a composite character -- your Dad, my Dad, a little of Maggies Dad...
No, its just Dad.	Maybe Angry Dad needs a sidekick -- Know-It-All Sister.
Hm. Your pencilling is sub-Ziggy, and the main character is off model in every frame. However, I deem this rack-worthy.	Wow, I made it! My week-long dream has come true.
Look, hes fitting right now.	Stan Lee came back?
Im from the Internet. Wed like to turn Angry Dad into an animated series.	Wow! Angry Dad... an internet cartoon. Ill be in cyberspace next to the Nabisco cookie web site.
Whoa!	This is people working?
This is people working?	This is great.
Hey, Bart. Care for a childrens cappuccino?	What up, man? This is my manager slash sister, Lisa.
Everyone here loves Angry Dad. Its just what weve been looking for.	So what do you want to do with it?
Bart, meet the voice of Angry Dad.	Okay, lets hear it.
Well, I was thinking of something like... Im a big fat idiot.	Wow! I think we have our Angry Dad.
In five minutes, itll be on the world wide web.	I cant wait that long.
This has been a Bart-toon presentation.	In association with Ay Carumba Entertainment.
Uh, uh... were just rehearsing for Angry Dad The Motion Picture.	Howd you like to be played by John Goodman?
Heres a preview. GOD SAID TO NOAH / BUILD YOURSELF AN ARK-Y ARK-Y / ANIMALS CAME ON BY ONES AND TWOSIES, TWOSIES / ELEPHANTS AND KANGAROOSIES - ROOSIES...	This little trap is gonna make my Dad angrier than hes ever been. In the meantime, I gotta tell those internet guys to hold tight.
Can I come too?	Good idea. You can speak nerd to them.
Looks like the bubble burst.	Bubbles can burst?!
Ow!	What do you mean its over?
Were bankrupt. The stock is at zero.	But I have fifty-two million shares! Whats fifty-two million times zero? And dont tell me its zero!
Looks like you cant retire by age twelve.	Yeah, but at least now that my shows cancelled, I dont need material, so theres no need to lure my Dad into the trap I set up for him. The trap!
Bart, your prank caused ten million dollars in damages.	I know. Im sorry.
Manjula!	Say it, dont spray it.
Youre trying to get me angry, thank you.	Youre not welcome.
I love you, boy.	Ha, ha, you love a boy.
Stop it now.	If you love me so much, why dont you marry me? Thats a good one.
Hi-Yo!	The Squishee Lady!
Look whos here. Its this thing!	I am Ganeesh, your god!
Oh, I am truly screwed.	I order you to get back together... or Ill suck your blood. Blah, blah!
Bart, stick to the script. Dont be a jerk.	Youre the jerk.
Hey, Apu, I think she likes you.	This Squishee is awful!
I liked all the roles filled by minority actors.	Why, I didnt even notice!
Oh boy, this takes me back. Two ration stamps and an artillery shell full of Oleo.	Whats your Nostalgia Prize, Grampa?
Party tonight at Roddy McDowells. Ooh!	I got a plastic Krusty-saurus.
I got a plastic Krusty-saurus.	Hmmm...
Laziness is counter-revolutionary! Questions are decadent! Fast hands mean less whipping!	Ow!
Skeeter bites are good luck. Scratch it and you get a wish.	I dont feel so good. Can you take me to the hospital?
Now youre sure you havent been to China? Theres no shame in it.	No, I told you, a mosquito came out of my Laffy Meal and bit me.
I knew it was serious when he said he didnt want ice cream.	I did want ice cream.
Now dont worry, these pills will take care of everything. But for a week Bart will be highly infectious to others.	Contagious? Outrageous!
Contagious? Outrageous!	I got me some teachers to lick.
Well, I dont know about that. But dont worry, while youre infectious, you will lead a normal life, full of normal social interaction.	I dont like how many times you said normal.
Youll get the hang of it. Todays just a little gusty.	Everyones staring at me.
Bart, dont slurp your soup.	My bubble, my rules.
Its just an expression. Like kick your butt could involve no kicking whatsoever.	Never fear, the sphere is here!
I know just how you feel -- isolated, alone, cut off from everyone--	Are you kidding? This little baby has made me more popular than ever.
Call me!	The bubble makes everything shimmer and glow. You cant believe what that sunset looks like to me.
Thats not a sunset. Thats a bird on fire!	Tomato, tomato.
Oh, I wish I had someplace to call my own. No one wants me around any more.	I know a way you can win back the kids at school.
Really? Thats wonderful. But how?	All you gotta do is play a prank on the principal.
Well I cant do it tomorrow. Theres an assembly in his honor.	Weve got a little planning to do. Step into my office.
Ew! Bart!	It wasnt me.
Li-sa! Li-sa! Li-sa!	Good going, Lis. And it sure is great to be out of that bubble.
Sure is sunny... Was the air always this fresh?... Im just gonna hang out in this vent.	Does this thing suck or blow? Suuuuck!
If he wants to sleep with us, forget it.	Put him down, boy! Put him down!
Oh dear, now everyone will think Homer and I did it. The real killer is the man with the braces.	Yeah, if Dad killed everyone he talked about killing, would any of us be here?
Younguns, meet your new brother and sister. Theys worth five dollars a day, county money.	Im Bart and this is Lisa.
Mom, Dad, thank God youre okay.	We were in the Green Room. I had so much shrimp!
Thus ends the Rule of Law.	Look at those looters breaking windows, setting fires... Theyre living my dream, and you wont let me join them. Please can I throw one little...
No.	What if I just burn down a...
No.	Cant I at least incite further...
No! Ive caused enough trouble already by plugging in that Santa Claus. No more irresponsible behavior.	Can I have a beer?
Yeah. Wiggum couldnt catch cooties at Milhouses birthday party.	Dad...
Hold your heads up high, kids.	I didnt know my chin went that far up.
What a character.	Cool, a lie detector.
Cool, a lie detector.	Lisa is a dork. Lisa is a dork.
Maude Flanders, we the living beseech you to appear.	Ne-e-ed, Im ba-a-ack! Give me a ki-i-iss.
Ne-e-ed, Im ba-a-ack! Give me a ki-i-iss.	Chill out dudes, its me, Bart Simpson.
Chill out dudes, its me, Bart Simpson.	What are you lookin at?
Hm. Does Dad seem a little... dumber than usual?	Me not notice.
I dream of a world without guns. Dont we all, William.	Lisa has a dead boyfriend!
And you sing one about robbin banks.	CALFS IN THE FIELD SO YOU SNEAK UP SLOW / GRAB IM BY THE TAIL AND GO MAN GO...
We prefer Italian-American pigs.	Hey Dad, check it out!
Dear Dad, Took money for the school book fair.	Homer, I need cash or theyre gonna break my legs.
What? Wait a... That cant be right! Wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?	No, it was the night you got loaded at Moes and the car had to be towed home.
Oh, wont anyone pretend to believe me?	I will, Dad.
That is so sweet.	I had no idea, Dad. I just assumed with all the stranglings, you know...
Please dont say any more!	Sorry we ruined your life, Homer.
Hey, whats this suitcase for? Are we going on a trip?	You are.
You cant just leave me out here! Theres not another woman for miles!	Sorry, Dad. Maybe now youll appreciate us...
And you take me places you hate, like museums, plays, and the Olive Garden.	And even though you knew I ratted you out to the IRS, you never busted me on it.
I knew nothing!	Stop kicking me, Dad!
My dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. I was so close to being a rock star, but now theres a chance it might not happen. Ill just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing.	Finally. Can we go now?
Look, theres Dad!	Woo! Yay, Homer!
Stupid writers and actors, priced yourselves right out of the business. Nice going, geniuses.	Hey, lets get one of those home satellite dishes! Then we can stop suckling on the six-network teat.
Oh, its red wire to red wire. What idiot dreamed that up?	And the Lord said, Let there be crap.
... and thereby reducing the number of states to forty-nine.	Cool! Its the NBC news feed!
Mmm... feed...	You get to see what they do during commercial breaks.
Oh Lord, Im so fat.	Hey Lis, wanna try some satellite TV? Weve got Japanese Friends.
Your comeback shames me.	How about the Clock Channel?
Coming up on the Clock Channel... six oclock!	Wait a minute, I saw this one.
Bart, I have to study for the Elementary School Achievement Test. And so do you.	Hey, I dont have to study on the weekend.
Bart, the test is in two hours. And you havent slept in a fortnight.	Whats a fortnight?
Lisa, because of your outstanding score on yesterdays big test, youre being immediately moved up to... the third grade!	Shes not so great! She got diarrhea when we went to Carlsbad Caverns!
Okay, the sun rises in the east, so the rooster would probably want to lay it on the cool side...	Roosters dont lay eggs. Theyre boys.
Very good, Bart.	Mm-hm.
Bart, Im doing my geography homework.	I know. Thats how you remember the four original provinces of Canada Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario, Nova Scotia -- Quiet nerds burp only near school. And heres how you remember the principal exports Dogs eat barf solely on Wednesday, Mabel.
Nice work, Bart.	An A? Copacetic.
You did better than me?!	Eh, I took this test last year. The answer key never changes. B-C-B-C-A-A-B-B-C-C-D-False-False-True-William Jennings Bryan.
All right, everybody choose a buddy for the field trip.	Ill take Kyle!
Ow! You are such an immature-- punch buggy white!	Ow!
Whats Punch Buggy?	When you see a Volkswagen Bug, you punch somebody and yell the color.
Order, order, order! The chair recognizes the esteemed representative from Capital City...	The Capital City Goofball?
This lively debate has given me an idea. Tonight, each buddy team is going to design a new state flag...	Homework on a field trip? What have you been huffin?
The status quo.	When I get through with that flag, its gonna be a Bart Mangled Banner.
So, I understand you children have some state flags for me. Who would like to go first?	We would, Governor Bailey! Team Simpson!
That was my worst unfurling ever!	Lisa, how could you? The governor is crying.
Bart, I am so mad at you!	You should have seen the look on your face. It was something like this.
They left without you too, you idiot.	If Im such an idiot, how come Im the smartest kid in the third grade?
Because youve already done it once.	Youve lost me.
Oh, forget it. Hey, how do we get back?	No problem. Well just circle around like those kids in The Blair Witch Project.
No problem. Well just circle around like those kids in The Blair Witch Project.	I must be getting close! I recognize that girl.
Oh Bart, I think were lost.	I used to be lost. Until a friend turned me onto a book. A book that changed my life. Its called Lisa is Stupid.
What do you care?	Here.
Bart, youre my big brother. You should act like it more often. You know, protect me from the bad things in the world.	Well, as far as nerdy little sisters go, youre the coolest.
Thanks, Bart.	And Im sorry I sabotaged your flag.
Im sorry I got us lost out here.	Oh, and Im sorry I sawed the heads off your Malibu Stacy dolls. Okay, you go.
I dont think Ive done anything else.	Okay, Ill go again. Remember when your bike was mangled by gypsies?
Yes.	Yeah, funny story. One day, I was really bored. And Dad had left the steam roller idling in the driveway...
Say your prayers.	Oh Lord, please strike these mountain folk dead--
Well, if this episode has taught us anything, its that nothing works better than the status quo. Bart, youre promoted back to the fourth grade.	Yay!
Bart, remember when I was crying at recess? Well, I think Im finally ready to tell you why.	Lets see whats on TV.
I stick my neck out for no one, Frankenstein, no one.	Oh cool, the old Batman show.
Sweet Valley High! Krusty played a Batman villain?	Well, sure. He was also Uncle Velderschmoink on Bewitched.
My, this is taking a long time.	Cool! We should try that at school!
Wait, this just doesnt add up. Milhouse has never been anything but a comic foil.	Hey, whats going on here, something crazy?
Theres your queen bee! Explain yourself, Simpson.	Uh, I saw Krusty do it on TV!
Bart, this is all your fault.	Dont worry. Krusty always lands on his feet.
They do make my neck look thinner... Oh, all right, lets do it.	Mom, Lisa pushed me in the laundry basket.
Maybe Ill just keep these.	Thats great, Mom. But dont forget...
Thats great, Mom. But dont forget...	I GOT KRUSTY IN HOT WATER / NOW IVE GOT TO HELP HIM OUT / DA DA DA...
Shut up, boy.	Oh, I dont get a song? Mom got a song.
Well, if by shoot you mean teach and by my head you mean safety. Then, yes.	Oh man, now they wont let Krusty do anything fun.
Maybe if we cut his foot off, people will feel sorry for him.	Hey, it didnt help your dad get your mom back.
Hi Mrs. Simpson. My mom said Im not to look at you.	Whats with the belt, Mom?
Its for my back spasms. If guys didnt keep pinching my tush, Id never stand up straight.	I thought you liked all the attention you were getting.
Howd you get in here?	The doorman died.
Oh no, he was my agent!	Listen, I have a plan that will make the world fall in love with Krusty the Clown again.
Its too late. Ive given up.	The Krusty I know didnt get where he is by givin up.
No, I got where I am by naming names in the fifties. Okay, whats your plan?	Its simple. We just have to cause a riot at the Springfield Shoe Expo.
Help! Help!	Who will save this promising young honor student?
Well, you saved Krustys reputation.	And you learned that a woman doesnt need a forty-eight inch chest to be beautiful.
Thats how I felt all along.	Lisa learned a lesson! Lisa learned a lesson!
Cant beat a skybox. All the excitement of being in the sky, with the security of being in a box.	Whoa, this is gonna be the coolest basketball game ever!
Actually, it says here were gonna see hockey.	Nooo!
Paint your portrait, Sir?	Can you paint me knocking out Larry Holmes?
Dont hit my face.	Okay, where do you want it?
Yeah! Go Ice-o-topes!	This sucks. How come Lisa gets something and I dont?
Why dont we stay at a youth hostel?	I do not want another lecture from a German backpacker about how we dont appreciate the national park system.
So how do you afford such a sweet pad?	What the hell was that?
Welcome to your home for the next six months.	Oh man, I cant wear this. I look like Buster Brown, whoever that is.
I need that tape!	Good morning, ladies.
It takes six hours to make breakfast now.	Hey, you should see how much trouble Dads having shaving with a straight razor.
Almost done.	This has been the worst week of my life. I miss my toys, my video games... Mutt n Jeff comics are not funny.
This has been the worst week of my life. I miss my toys, my video games... Mutt n Jeff comics are not funny.	Theyre gay, I get it.
Bread tastes like clothes.	Im so cold.
Bart, honey, would you like some more cod liver oil?	Yes, mum. I thought I was regular before, but I was wrong.
Lets take lunch, people.	Do we get lunch?
If we formed a club we could serve drinks.	Hey Dad, why dont we watch you drink from a hose?
Truly, that was the greatest re-generation.	This place blows. Im gonna go float a Baby Ruth down the mineral bath.
It still beats Disneys California Adventure.	Mm hm.
Well then, you might as well stay with us. We serve the same meat the prisons do!	Wait. Wait. Wait. Bob cant stay with us. This man has tried to kill me so much its not funny anymore.
Oh come now. As gentlemen, surely we can just agree to... God D...!	Sorry.
I thought I could get it while it was in the re-charger I... was... wrong.	I dont know how we ever had fun without him.
I... I cant do it.	Huh? Why not?
I KNOW THIS CHUBBY SCALAWAG / HAS MADE MY LIFE A LIVING HELL. / SURELY IF I DRANK HIS BLOOD / ID BE AT PEACE -- BUT, WELL...	YOUVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO MY FACE...
This isnt a duet!	Sorry.
Now, the topic for your research paper will be World War One...	Was that the war with Hitler or Merlin?
Dammit. Why did I pay for a hundred Xeroxes, when I only wanted one? Well, I guess someone else will use the other ninety-nine.	Prank or study? Prank or study?
Prank or study? Prank or study?	What should I do, Lord? Give me a sign.
Russia, Great Britain and France had formed an entente cordiale...	Ooh, algebra... Ill just do a few equations. No! No more distractions!
Hey Bart, wanna go for a ride in my uncles Black Hawk helicopter?	But I just started my paper.
Its your last chance -- hes probably gonna get court-martialed for this.	Black Hawk up!
But Im not tired!	Oh, this is great stuff -- I can pad it out to ten pages. Goodnight, Grampa.
Youre gonna have to redo your paper after class.	Well, if I may dust off an old chestnut, aye carumba. Aye carumba indeed.
Ill be back in three hours. Maybe less. But almost certainly more.	Hes a wiener, Mrs. K. Just say the word and his desk is full of boogers.
Dead Poets Society has destroyed a generation of educators.	Okay, theres a lot of low cards in that hand. But since were both free, why dont you and me hit the town?
I cant believe you went to the movies with the teacher. What happened to the Bart Simpson who put the mothballs in the beef stew?	Hey, I only hung out with Krabappel because Skinner blew her off. Ive never seen her so sad.
You know what made me feel better about myself? That award I got for Worlds Greatest Dad.	Dad, you bought that, because it was full of gummy worms.
Hey Bart, you could nominate Mrs. Krabappel for an actual award, The Teacher of the Year. Then shell feel appreciated.	They have an award for teaching?
Next!	Id like to nominate my teacher, Mrs. Krabappel. She may not be glamorous or entertaining... Shes just a real teacher who comes in every day no matter what. And she never gave up on me, Bart Simpson.
Weve had our ups and downs, but I cant imagine life without him...Bart Simpson.	I cant express how I feel in words, so I drew this picture.
Ow! Mother! We were sharing an open-mouthed kiss!	These stink lines stand for dedication, caring, and for letting me drink coffee in class. Way to go, Edna!
Orlando? Are we going to Sea World?	Nope.
Disney World?	Uh-uh.
Universal Studios?	Fraid not.
Leisure World?	Sorry, Grampa.
Gator Gulch?	You wish.
Leisure World?	Grampa, youre not even going.
Dont look back. Just keep driving.	Seymour? Glad youre here. You can help me play Halloween Hit and Run.
Ooh, this game is gonna get some disapproving clucks. But for now I need my tongue to talk to you. I dont want to lose Edna, so I need you to sabotage her chances of winning tonight.	But I dont want to hurt Mrs. K.
All right, Bart, I didnt want to resort to this, but... this drawing was found on the wall of Springfield Elementary late last week.	All right, Im in. Ill humiliate the love of your life. Because I like you, Ill even do it pro boner.
Thats pro bono.	I know what I said.
And now, Bart Simpson will ask a question to his teacher.	W-u-w-h-a-a-t... W-w-wuh... h-h-huh...
Hurry up, son.	Im sorry, I cant read. Mrs. Krabappel never taught me to read!
Hey, I could really use one of those.	No arguments here. Man, I really come off like a jerk in this thing.
Oh-my-God-oh-my-God-oh-my-God.	Dad, you cant eat all those free samples. Weve got to get Lisas present.
More free samples.	Dad, you ate all the free samples. Now youre eating mens slacks.
Trying to keep those crushes secret, eh Romeo?	Its not for me. Im not a girl like you.
A laser pointer! Thanks, Bart.	Its really cool. You can point a red dot at peoples crotches from really far away.
Oh, Lisas still mad at me.	Im still mad at you for chopping up my skateboard with an axe.
Oh, I cant stop worrying about Homer and Lisa.	Aw, Mom... Thisll take your mind off them.
Oh boy, is this awkward.	Shes in the back yard!
Fine. Ill just take this!	Come on, Mom, lets go.
Come on, Mom, lets go.	Mom, are you okay?
Mom, you didnt get the milk.	And you parked on top of the mailman.
Yep, but youre still safe at home. After a few practice trips here, the real Kwik-E-Mart will be a piece of cake. Now, Bart will play Apu...	Um hm.
Listen kids, your Mom is going to be living in the basement. But with our love, shell get better soon.	What if she doesnt?
Amen. Over.	Breaker, breaker. Bartman to shut-in. The big guys asleep. Please advise. Over.
Whack him with the hymnal. Over.	I roger that big time.
Bart, eat your spinach.	No way.
I can bench twice as much as when I started! And look at my abs!	Mom!
Ooh, you know what would zest up this hollandaise? A lemon!	Dad, do you plan to get in shape?
No, actually, Im going to eat twice as much.	Excellent.
Mornin kids! I made your lunches. Theyre on the table.	Huh? Why didnt Mom make our lunch?
Now lets meet the ladies who our doctors assure us are women the Iron Maidens!	Ay carumba! Im off women forever.
In second place Marge Simpson!	Second place!? Oh man, thisll just encourage her.
Yeah, well, nachos are nachos.	Whoa! Check out Janeane Giraffe-alo.
Thats Fung Pang-Li, the seven-foot sensation from Szechwan!	Szechwan, eh? No wonder shes so spicy.
Bart, youre a little young to be growling at seven foot Chinese ladies.	Fine, Ill go back to being bored.
Look! Thats Lisa Leslie! She showed little girls everywhere that they can grow up to be six foot five!	Lisa Leslie, you got game!
I think you mean I have game. Try to speak correctly.	You go girl!
Dad, this ticket is for tomorrows WNFL game!	The Cowgirls versus the She-gles. No love lost there.
Look, this church is our only option. Dont you kids want to live here?	Anythings better than that dump we came from.
I CANT GET ENOUGH OF YOU, BABY...	Dad, theres a bunch of people in the Community Outreach Center.
Gods ignoring me.	Dad, maybe you should stop praying. See if that makes It happy.
There are perfectly logical explanations for everything that happened. The bonfire sent soot into the air which created rain. And with all the trees cut down, a flood was inevitable.	Yeah, but what made the rain stop?
Ooh, Mad libs!	Hey, a box of old videotapes.
Hey, a box of old videotapes.	Hm, Marge and Homer Get Dirty.
Hm, Marge and Homer Get Dirty.	Hey, Lis! Think youre well adjusted? Ive got something to show you.
Dont go telling your buddies at work about this.	Every tape is pumpkin carving.
This isnt BART SAD. Its BARTS AD.	Wait, I was in a commercial? I dont remember this at all.
Honey, you did have a great time doing those commercials. And you made a lot of money.	I did? Where is it?
La la la la la la la. Nothing left. La la la... la... la.	You spent all the money I earned?!
See, Bart. I saved you.	You stole my money!
Bart, the larynx is not a plaything.	Mom, I am sick of the way he treats me. He disrespects me and Im just supposed to accept it?
It was worth it.	I just wish there was some way to get back at my Dad.
When my Mom wants to get back at my Dad, she uses her lawyer.	Does it make him cry?
You whaaa?!	I said I want a divorce from my parents.
Bart, youre suing us?!	Yes, I want to be emancipated.
I wanted a sewing room. But not like this. Not like this!	Mom, youve always been cool to me. But Homer is a lousy dad and Im not gonna take it anymore.
Bart, using this doll, tell the court where your father took money from you.	Here... and here.
Bart, where are you gonna live?	With the money Dads paying me, I rented a loft downtown.
Do you even know what a loft is?	No. I assume it has hay.
Oh, Im gonna miss you.	Heres something to remember me by.
Ow! Indian burn!	Look at it.
Aw, thats so sweet.	If I did it right, its permanent.
Please dont go, Bart. Ill let you swear in the house. Everything but the big three.	Sorry Mom. I just cant. Not as long as hes here.
Either give me some of that, or lets get going.	Sorry Mom. I gotta go.
Oh, Puppy Goo Goo, fetch me a dream.	Boy, its really empty in here.
Boy, its really empty in here.	Now calm down. Im perfectly safe. Murders illegal in this state.
Okay, that was just my imagination.	Mommy!
Not up! Down!	Im gonna die in my jammies!
Hey, its an emancipated minor! Whats your name?	Im-Im Bart Simpson, and-- Hey, are you skateboarding legend Tony Hawk?
Oh wait. Thats my old phone number.	You live in this building?
When Im not on the road or in rehab for my shattered pelvis. I hope you dont mind living below a bunch of pro skaters who like to party.	Ill adjust.
Nice.	Oh man, this is the greatest night of my life. If my Dad could see this hed be so mad.
Thanks for the lift, Tony Hawk. Ive gotta go now, Tony Hawk.	Cool guy, Tony Hawk.
Bart, you know Tony Hawk?	Please, Im trying to keep it quiet. Catch ya later, Tony Hawk.
Wow, this place is great. That couch looks really pricey.	Well, you need an expensive couch to watch an expensive TV.
Of course, because you wouldnt want to... I paid for your splendor, you...!	...And for every syringe I find, I get a dollar.
You know son, Ive been doing a lot of thinking. I was wrong to exploit you, and I wont do it again.	Thanks Dad, that means a lot to me.
So, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?	Sorry, no can do. Im taking off for six months to join the Skewed Tour.
Skewed Tour? The traveling festival of rock n roll, skateboarding and extreme sports?	And nipple piercing.
Im challenging you, Hawk. In front of all these outcasts and dreamers, who cant even get into the army, if you can believe it.	Dad, how drunk are you?
Woo hoo! I rule this pseudo sport! Come back to me, boy!	Dad, you dont understand. This was never about being cool. It was about you not caring how I felt.
What did they say about my scalp?	Dont worry, Dad, its just a commercial. No one will remember this in fifty years.
Welcome to Matinee of Blood and Commercials. I am your hostess, Booberella. Our first fright flick is 1983S Frankenstein and the Harlem Globetrotters Meet the Mummy and the Washington Generals.	I cant just sit here watching this junk.
I cant just sit here watching this junk.	Thats better.
Wow, I cant wait to pack that into my colon.	Dude, take it easy on the fatty foods. Youre running out of leg veins to transplant into your heart.
I got arm veins, dont I?	Yes, sir.
Indeed there will. Budgetwise, of course.	Nelson, how was your summer?
Sucked.	Whatd you do?
Um, wed better get down to business. As this is a non-leap year, were already a day behind.	Cmon man, everyone knows the first day of school is a total wank.
Bart, your word is imply.	Imply. I-M-P...
Bart said I am pee! Hes made of pee!	Well, I got my laugh. Im outta here.
I-M-P...	Hey, Lisa said she was--
Lisa, Im so impressed youre state champ.	Finally, a Simpson has a trophy without a bowling ball on it.
Really? He possesses the properties of a pine needle?	Look, I didnt bring a GameBoy. This is all I got.
Weve got another surprise for you...	Ay carumba!
Well, Im all set. Im gonna be following the latest designs from Modern Sandcastle magazine.	Well, Im all set, too.
Then all thats left is to protect Maggie from the sun.	I think she needs a diaper change.
What a sight! It happens every year like the swallows returning to Capistrano.	Or the Fox Network getting a new President.
Sara Sloane has been involved with every Tinseltown hunk from Affleck to Zmed!	Yeah, shes had more stars on her than Lisas homework.
Ill have you know she pays full price for all her watercraft!	Rainier Wolfcastle!?
Oh, so it is. Ive already dumped three on Mia Farrow. Sucker!	Look, its celebrity boy-toy Ned Flanders and his arm candy, Sara Sloane.
Why is that jet flying so close to our house?	Why dont you ask those guys?
Eww! I got Barts veal!	I got Lisas plankton kebabs!
Because at Channel Six, we got nothin else!	Hey, Krusty should run for Congress. He could help us with the airplanes!
Have your mom mail back the hat after... you know.	Im not dying.
Yeah, thats the spirit. Keep fightin. Wheres my Chai latte?	Krusty, we need you to run for Congress.
IRS, ATF, Immigration...	Immigration?
Oh uh, Teeny here is from Brazil. His uncle was the head monkey at the Bureau of Tourism.	But, if you get elected, you can change all that, and stop those stupid airplanes from flying over my house.
Yeah, I could even tell the FCC to take a hike. Look at this list of words they wont let me say on the air.	Aw, all the good ones. Hmm, Ive never even heard of number nine.
Its doin thirteen while shes elevening your five.	Can I keep this?
Ooh, three bean salad!	Sorry, you cant join us. This is a hundred dollar a plate Krusty fundraiser.
Election night is so exciting. Im on pins and needles.	Krusty, I cant believe youre giving up. I thought youd make a difference, thats why I voted for you.
How could you vote? Youre only ten.	This is not about me. Or how many times I voted.
My Christmas shoppings done.	Poor Krusty.
Sorry, Krusty. But theres no way Im letting your Airline Rerouting Bill out of committee.	Congressman, I have a tape here of you using your free-mail privilege to send a get well card to your aunt.
Oh, well be upstairs, in the bedroom making love... ly rope ladders in case theres a fire.	Oh, okay.
Children, so naÃ¯ve.	What?
Well, if you dont know the right path to take, you have to be very quiet and listen for that little voice inside that tells you what to do.	Do it, Dad. You could get a less- crappy car.
Bart, you can hear us?	Oh yeah. From my room I can hear everything.
This is it, boy. With this bird gone, the plant will be mine for the taking.	Now fly -- To the Canary Islands!
Lisa, I deeply resent...with a big bowl of applesauce.	Hey Dad, you said you were gonna play catch with me tonight.
Well, I have to work, but give the monitor a kiss.	I dont wanna do that.
From now on, my only ambition is to be the worlds greatest Dad.	Hey! You nearly hit me on the head!
Oh, you want a piece of me?	Ysee? This is the stuff Mom wont do with me.
Before we begin, children, may I remind you the school computers are not to be used to access PrincipalSkinnerStinks.com, Skinnersucks.org or Shavedskinner.edu.	He didnt say anything about Skinner-in-a-shredder.com.
On todays royal agenda, digging up dirt clods to throw at his school chums.	I chuck em at nerds, girls I like, whatever.
I chuck em at nerds, girls I like, whatever.	Ow!
Munch mud, Simpson!	Im telling! Oh, man.
Since Nelson nailed you with that dirt, no one thinks youre cool anymore. Even that kid that wears diapers is more popular. And he aint popular.	So? Ill bounce back. I always bounce back -- like after the time I accidentally called the teacher Mom.
This is great! Its darker than a French chicks armpit!	Every cars been harvested!
Every cars been harvested!	Ive got to get that hood ornament. No matter who owns it.
Youre gonna depreciate a Mafia Dons car?	Hey, were all gonna be murdered some day.
You know Bart, I really like spending time with you.	Just hold the light.
Bart, I just realized -- we both want the same thing darkness. And we can get it if we work together, with my brain and your... your... assistance.	You can say it. I add nothing.
You cant have lights without power, and all the power comes from here.	Howd you get Dad to go along with this?
Now we merely push this switch to Overload. Yet once we do, well be breaking the law. Can good truly come from civil disobedience? Gandhi thought so...	But Gandhi also said less talk, more rock!
Night... glorious night...	Uh-oh.
I hope its as fun as Pictionary was last week.	Dad, we werent playing Pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking.
The first step is the funnest -- turning all the pieces face up.	Go crazy, dorks. I got better things to do.
Hey Bart, I fixed my rock tumbler. What do you say we turn this baby loose on some feldspar?	Im in.
Or when I messed up taping City Slickers 2 and cut off the end. Was Curlys gold just a legend?	Or like when... I got nothin. Uh, lets just find that piece.
Or like when... I got nothin. Uh, lets just find that piece.	Hey, remember that pet gerbil we used to have? He didnt run away after all.
Oh. Time to repress another memory.	I-am-at-Disneyland.
Kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think.	But youre not gonna get divorced like Milhouses parents, are you?
Dad took us antiquing!	Yeah, and along the way we took photos of interesting doors and gates.
Marge, please. Lets not fight in front of the kids. Just secretly hate me the way you always have.	Hey, I love watching you guys fight. Its my earliest memory.
Why you little...!	Dad, your hands feel so soft.
You noticed! Ive been using LancÃ´me.	Oh, it shows! I havent had a strangle that smooth since I was four.
Lisa, marriage is a beautiful thing. But its also a constant battle for moral superiority. So I cant apologize.	Couldnt you just say youre sorry and not mean it? I do it all the time. I dont think Ive ever meant it.
Bart! Thats not right.	Sorry, Mom. See, its that easy!
What? It said take one.	Balloon ride, wax museum, the Denzel Washington monument, colonial Phoenix, hey, dude ranch!
Balloon ride, wax museum, the Denzel Washington monument, colonial Phoenix, hey, dude ranch!	And theres no radio or TV, so we wont have to hear your song!
Ill show you how they get on a horse where I come from.	Daddy, I need upsies!
Pleased to meet ya! Have a tooth.	Hey Crabby Hayes, get with the program!
Mom, why are you talking like that?	I thought you guys lived off the land. How come youre selling junk to jerks like us?
No! I wanted to die choking on food!	Ill save you!
Check it out, beavers. Delicious motel furniture!	They took the bait. Lets go.
Thats a seventeen-dollar deck of cards!	Let it go, Dad.
Need-help-now-come-with-me-done-something-terrible!	Dont-really-care-just-terribly-caught-up-in-moment!
... So I sent Lukes sister down the wrong trail and... Hey! Whered all this water come from? There used to be a trail here! And there used to be a beaver dam there.	Who are you, the usedta police?
How can we get across?!	Hey beavers! Remember me, you buck-toothed nerds?
Hel-lo, handsome!	Whats up, Cootie Breath?
Woo hoo! In your face, imaginary guy!	Hey, lets see if Dads song is finally off the air.
BECAUSE SHES DEAD...	Mr. Secretary, can you read the minutes of our last meeting?
Girls are yucky, seconded and carried. A fart was detected, Martin denied it and so was ruled to have supplied it.	Good. Security officer, anything on scope?
Each year we lose seven species of gumdrops...	Lisa, this is your mother.
Lisa, this is your mother.	The doctor says your butts too big!
Dont worry, son. Ill build you a new treehouse. One so grand itll be an affront to God himself.	Can it have a rope ladder you can pull up after you?
Well, two can play at that game.	Oh, thats it. You are going down.
Strong words. Strong words from a strange man.	Dont worry, boy. Well get you out of the dog house. And then you and Dadll be chasing butterflies together again.
Welcome back to the family, boy.	Dad, five minutes ago you hated him.
Cut to commercial!	Hey boy, this is your commercial!
There you are, old pal! I finally found ya.	Who the hell are you?
Kent, let me make this perfectly clear. I have no dog.	Dad, you cant let him take our dog!
My wads! I never even broke the wrapper.	Whos gonna eat my homework now?
Okay, boy. Fetch!	What do you do for fun?
Cmon, Suds. Toss me a bone.	Poor Santas Little Helper, hes overworked.
Well Im afraid the law is clear and Dad did renounce all claim to ownership.	But I miss him. He was my best friend.
Okay, if you have six liters of blood and your blood is eighty per cent alcohol, how much alcohol do you have? Anyone?	Hey, Duffman!
Help! Help! Im drowning!	Uh oh! Who will save that poor fat man?
To me that says I love you.	I think he left a big hug in your lunch box.
I thought I was being kicked exceptionally hard lately.	If I could be any type of shark, Id be a tiger shark. How bout you, Milhouse?
I did it. I walked all the way to Moes from my house.	Way to go, Dad!
How could you both miss the bus to school?	We touched hands and then we had to wash the cooties off.
My show and tell project... a Peruvian fighting frog.	Hey! I brought a Peruvian fighting frog!
Yay! I wanna amble!	I wanna saunter!
Amble!	Saunter!
Amble!	Saunter!
Now Id like to propose a toast to a woman whos done so much for us without getting anything in return.	Except a place to live and free food.
I hear those kids voices are done by grownups.	Hey, theres nothing wrong with that. I just wonder how they keep it so fresh after forty-three episodes.
Im bored.	Hey, Ive got an idea. Lets tie a string around a fly.
Cool. Do you think bugs feel pain?	If they dont, Ive wasted a lot of my life.
I wish I could fly. Then Id be the most popular kid in school.	Knowing you, youd mess it up somehow.
Ill go contact the nearest adult!	Theres no time. Were going in!
My eyeglass repair kit!	Let it go.
Let it go.	Well, what do you know, cats eat flies.
Sometimes I wish a cat would eat me.	Dude, were in Flanders house -- unsupervised.
Bright, brighter, brightest... off, bright, brighter, brightest... off.	That is so gay.
That is so gay.	These losers are out of peanut butter.
Peanuts... butter... now, we just put the top on...	Hey, I didnt get where I am putting tops on things.
What are the Beatles?	Who is he talking to?
John Lemon, Orange Harrison, Paul McIced Tea, Mango Starr? Hey Bart, how bout a blast from the past?	A forty-year-old novelty beverage? Hand it over!
It was the Monkees.	Please dont call our parents!
Of course I am. They were bigger than Jesus! But your boy went Yoko and broke up my collection.	Hey, boys will be boys.
They had to admit homosexuals.	How come Im not doing this stuff with Milhouse?
Lets see. What Native American activities should we do? Making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the Civil War.	Hey, Lazy Horse! Find us something cool to do.
Oh no! The Pawnee have returned. They probably want their souls back.	Wow Mom, I wish you were our tribe leader.
No way! If my old man sees me in these, hell kill me.	You havent seen your dad in years.
Our nature walk will be hosted by a full-blooded Native American. Say hello to Jim Proudfoot from the Mohican tribe.	Mohican? I thought you guys were all gone.
Clean it!	And why are we gonna do it?
Boy, I got up on the wrong side of the futon today.	Cavalry Kids? Thats pathetic.
Im a brick!	We will crush you and smother your dreams. Yours in Christ, the Cavalry Kids.
Your candy is tainted! The batboy prize is forever beyond your reach!	Candy for sale!
Candy for sale!	Get your un-poisoned candy!
Looks like this is one time the Indians didnt win.	Well, thats it. Theyve beaten us.
Well Im not finished. Where does it say we have to be gracious in defeat?	Its on the back of our vests.
Welcome fans of Americas favorite pastime... baseball? Here to perform the National Anthem are todays honorary bat boys, the Cavalry Kids, led by Milhouse Van Houten!	After this prank, everyones gonna hate those Cavalry Clods as much as we do.
Well, Bart. Weve learned that war is not the answer.	Except to all of Americas problems.
Does anyone else want to know why that sign is so funny?	No.
Way to go, Mom. Homemade dim sum, with eight kinds of dipping sauce!	This is the best Year of the Rat ever!
Yeah, its great that shes got a father-figure in her life. She--hey wait, thats supposed to be me!	You could be my father figure.
No way! Im not gettin my fingerprints on that train wreck. But if I lose Maggie, Im oh-for-three. Ive gotta get her back.	I can help you.
This partys boring. Everything here is for babies.	Im helping Daddy!
Im helping Daddy!	Lisa, it says one year and up.
Good grief, this candys terrible.	Circus peanuts, raisins, nicotine gum, a library card... You got all good stuff!
And yet Im still not satisfied.	You thieving hussy!
Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps. Beat the lumps.	Hey! / Ay carumba!
Why you little...	Please, dont take me! Take Milhouse. We all know theres no happy ending there.
Ow.	Cool.
Hm.	Dad, were all those people on the list?
Cool! Comics from the seventies!	Superman vs. Patty Hearst, Evel Knievel Jumps The Jackson 5, Batman and Rhoda...
Superman vs. Patty Hearst, Evel Knievel Jumps The Jackson 5, Batman and Rhoda...	Check out these ads!
Check out these ads!	Lets see... x-ray gum...
Lets see... x-ray gum...	Cool... Milhouse, do you have your change purse?
Here you go, son.	To stop time, click watch.
To stop time, click watch.	Wow, she looks like a background character in a Hanna Barbera cartoon!
Wow, she looks like a background character in a Hanna Barbera cartoon!	To restart time, click watch again.
If were both touching the watch, neither of us will be affected.	Do you realize what this means?
Yeah, but you say it first.	We can do anything we want!
Bart, look at the watch!	Milhouse! You broke the watch! Do you realize what this means?
Yeah, but you say it first.	Oh, man. Things are stuck like this forever.
Well, I couldnt be happier. Im the second coolest kid on earth.	Actually, I guess we can do anything we want... and no one will stop us.
Im gonna play naked basketball!	No youre not.
The family looks good.	Thanks. I just washed them.
Thanks. I just washed them.	That keeps happening.
Can I punch Oscar de la Hoya for a while?	Just keep it above the belt.
Just keep it above the belt.	You know, Milhouse? I thought Id love eating only frosting and giving the Pope a wedgie...
You know, Milhouse? I thought Id love eating only frosting and giving the Pope a wedgie...	But I miss being a regular kid in the real world, gettin a hug from my Mom...
Yeah, I thought Id be happy with my parents back together, but its kind of hollow.	All right. It says here we can learn watch repair in eight one-hour lessons.
Yeah, well I work better in a structured environment.	Here goes nothin...
Here goes nothin...	Wait, when people see all the stuff we did, theyre gonna want to kill us.
Oh come on, dont you get it? Bart stopped time with his magic stopwatch.	Jealous much?
Its too nice a day to be outside doing chores. Come in and watch TV.	Woo hoo! Mom finally stopped caring!
Ta-da!	Mom made the Oops Patrol! Hot damn!
From what, too much hot fudge? Huh? Cmon Bart, show me some love!	Dont drag me down with you, old man.
Psst. Hey pal. Hey buddy. Wake up. Wanna go on an adventure with your old man?	No.
They all do.	Fresh urine.
Aww, still my little crybaby.	Ill save you, Dad!
Ill save you, Dad!	Ka-ra-tÃ©!
Ka-ra-tÃ©!	Gramma!
Oh Bart, are you still a little hell-raiser?	Yesm.
Pizza was the first food he choked on.	Aww. So, why are you back in town?
Oh, definitely. If you ask me, shes far less dangerous than Bart.	If it please the court, I would like to go ape on my sister.
I object!	Judge, sidebar?
Very well.	Judge, do you have a little sister?
Yes. She used to call me Fatty-boomalatty. Ill allow an Indian burn.	Thank you, your honor.
You werent around for the birth of your grandson, and I want you to see it.	Wah, wah, wah. Aint I cute? You owe me a dirt bike.
Grandma, youll always be an inspiration to me.	You taught me a criminal can evade the law well into old age.
I couldnt sleep, because I thought there might be a sign of my Mom in one of these articles. They never did find her body.	Then what was in the coffin?
Hey, as long as were thinking about her, Grandmas still alive.	Cmon, big guy. Thisll help you get to sleep.
Well, I think I can say with all humility, I am gonna be the best school president ever.	Bravo, Lisa. Bra-vo.
Oh, isnt that sweet? Even your brothers adding his kudos.	I was being sarcastic.
You were?	No. I was being sincere.
Oh, Im so confused.	Lis, Skinner is using you. Like a pawn on his unholy chess set.
BUT IT HELPS ME GET THROUGH ANOTHER DAY / MY STOMACH IS FILLED WITH HAGGIS AND HURT / IVE GOT TO GO PUKE IN SOME HAY.	LISA IS A FOOL!
WHAT HAVE I DONE?	WHAT THEY WANTED YOU TO.
SKINNER BETRAYED ME!	BUT A TANGO TAKES TWO!
Okay, youll do.	Lis, you made this school even worse. And it wasnt exactly San Diego State to begin with.
Lisa, what are you doing? This is the kind of troublemaking I expect from your brother.	You do? Cool, a blank check for mayhem.
The heart of the strike is former student body president Lisa Simpson. Her brother had this to say	Lisa is a nut. She has a rubber butt. Every time she turns around it goes putt putt.
Hockey dads -- commence fighting!	Hockey Dad rules! Feel the drunken wrath of Chuck Shadowski!
Dad, stop! Its only assault... dont make it murder!	Ignore, ignore!
What?	Umm... theres a ladybug in your hair.
Get it out! Get it out!	Got it!
Youre a good friend, Bart.	The best youll ever have.
One thousand dollars. Do you know how much furniture we could rent with this?	Youll rent nothing! This money is mine. I found it!
Well, we put up a flyer.	Lets see someone claim that money now.
Im on it!	Uh-oh.
Describe. Sure, of course.	Whose picture is on it?
Uh... it would have to be somebody famous... Im gonna say Hitler?	Next!
Thats the last of them. You did the right thing, Bart, and now you can keep the money.	Sweet! What am I gonna do with a thousand dollars?
ITS BARTS MOON PARTY FROM OUTER SPACE / WITH R2-D2 PLAYING THE BASS...	No ones touching the hors doeuvres.
Oh, forget it. Bart, dont waste your money on me.	Great lady.
This must be worth like a million dollars.	Times up. Beat it, doo-rags.
If you let me keep looking at it Ill give you a quarter.	Hm, this gives me an idea.
Whats all this other stuff?	Hey, Im charging five bucks to get in. They deserve to see the boy behind the bill.
Young man, I believe you have something that belongs to me.	Prove it, Bony Curtis.
When the errant bill struck my chest, it left a distinctive bruise. Had my heart been inside at the time, it could have been fatal.	Its a perfect match!
Bart, your museum took in over three thousand dollars!	Finally, I can get what Ive always wanted... a used Toyota.
Bart, I dont care what Mom said. I think you should use this money to take her on a nice vacation.	Well... okay. For Mom, Ill do it. Where should we go?
Prime Minister Tony Blair!?	Why are you greeting low-lifes like us at the airport?
Word to the wise, British candy is a bit sweeter than what youre used to across the pond.	Look, teabag, just fork over the brown.
Macbeth! Ooh, now Ive said it.	This is cool. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
Thats quite all right. You didnt know. Now if youll excuse me, I have a performance to give.	Good luck!
Like saucers they are!	E claimed he was me father, he did.
Bart, youre not helping.	Poke the monster with a stick! Tuppence a jab! Cmon, queue up, lads.
Its partly my fault. Ive been nagging you so much on this trip, you couldnt know which nags to focus on.	Hey, Dad, why dont we try the Sprawl-Mart?
Dear God of England please let me go. In return I will spell the word color with a u and Ill use the metric system with every cubic milliliter of blood in my... oh, I cant do it. Its so stupid!	Dad!
Oh, my God! Weve made a terrible mistake. This tunnel comes out in the worst possible place.	An elephants butt?
Flow... yeah.	Lis, your stupid present will only last a week. Mine will sit in a closet for years.
Wow, look at all this stuff.	Oh look, Jaclyn Smith has her own line of axe heads!
Apparently were not TV pretty.	Wow! Its a machine that makes carnival food at home.
Todays clip comes straight from the Springfield dump.	Dad, you got attacked by a bear?!
I dont care if they think youre a coward, Dad. You did the right thing, hiding and crying.	Yeah, wed rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day.
Gentlemen, sometimes a man must put his marriage at risk for reasons that are confusing even to him.	Youre sneakin out to fight that bear. I wanna go too.
No way. If something happens to me, you have to carry on the Simpson name.	Screw that. When I grow up, Im legally changing my name to Joe Kickass.
I never realized how hot this suit is. Im sweating out all my blood-lust!	Why dont you take a bath in the river? This bear tracker stopped beeping a half hour ago.
Suh-weet.	Hey, the batteries are missing from this thing.
Mr. Connor, thank you for helping find my husband. I dont want my last words to him to be clip your toenails, they look like Fritos.	Mom! Mom! Stop the car!
Mom! Mom! Stop the car!	Dad went to take a bath and the bear carried him off!
He made it! Hes finally protected from man.	Yeah, but now hes being attacked by an elephant.
Son, can I have cuts?	No.
No.	Okay.
Oh God, its baby blood!	Dont worry, I know just what to do.
No, but Ill take one.	Okay.
Boy, that really passes the time.	Want a puppy?
I just found out Im not Jewish. I was turned down by all those country clubs for nothing.	Well, youre still my hero.
Now I know the reason my life is so empty. I never had a Bar Mitzvah.	Cheer up, Krusty. Youre a clue in the People Magazine crossword puzzle. What more can a man want?
Who knows? Ive lived so hard, theres big gaps in my memory. I remember learning to ride a bike, then pretty much nothing til right now.	Why dont we ask your dad?
Eh, so what? Its not my job to make kids laugh.	Yes it is, youre a clown.
Theres nothing in the Talmud that forbids it.	How do you know all this stuff?
No, Dad. I mean you should use your time on the air to say things that really mean something. Change the world for the better!	I say live fast, die young, and leave a big fat corpse.
You cant leave, Im your ride home!	Dad, you blew it. You listened to Lisa. And then you lost your stranglehold on the audience.
Awesome! Im blasting all the state capitals! Take that, Salem, Oregon!	Wait a minute, this game is educational!
Wait a minute, this game is educational!	Thatll teach you to teach me!
What a mall!	Can we get our big Christmas tree now?
Isnt it sufficient.	I thought we had enough money for a good tree.
Dad, what you saw was A Christmas Carol. It was written by Charles Dickens a hundred and sixty years ago.	Yeah, TV writers have been milkin that goat for years.
Pathetic Flanders. Thinking he can buy peoples love with thoughtful gifts.	Cool. Mr. Flanders gave me a Krusty brand Operation game.
Oh, joy, lets see what weve uh, got here... oh, its a new brassiere?! But I dont even have them, but okay! Ill make pretend.	What a great Christmas. Not even Moes annual suicide attempt can ruin it.
Like that!	Hey! Im watchin that!
Well also show you how to turn a shoebox into a you-box!	I missed the feeding frenzy. I hope youre happy.
TOPPED WITH CHOCOLATE SYRUP / TOPPED WITH CHOCOLATE SYRUP / WHIPPED CREAM TOO / WHIPPED CREAM TOO!	Mom, thats Roofi. His music is why babies are idiots.
Well, Maggie likes Roofi. And babies only like good things.	Why dont you let us watch TV and get her a Roofi CD?
Bart! Ont-day ell-tay om-may uffi-ray as-hay e-say e-days.	Y-whay ot-nay? Ut-whay ould-cay o-gay ong-wray?
Time to go home, Bart.	You dont understand -- I cant go home! You gotta give me detention. Look -- I fed the gerbil coffee!
Eh.	Please, make me write something on the chalkboard a thousand times!
It makes her happy.	So does sucking on the dog.
Well Lisa, I would be proud if one of the eggs I sold turned out like you.	Mom, I locked your keys in the car.
Then wait in the shadows!	Also, Maggie puked in your purse again.
No, the March primary.	Mom, can we get a pretzel?
Weve got pretzels at home.	Not cinnamon.
Bart, were gonna lose. We have to do something.	Lis, kids are the problem, maybe kids can be the solution.
Okay, but how?	Hey, Im the visionary. You come up with the nuts and bolts.
Oh my God! I just had my most brilliant idea ever!	Dont you mean my most brilliant idea ever?
You dont even know what the idea is.	I know you have an ugly face.
Bart, why are we fighting?	Because were kids. Kids! Maybe thats the answer.
Looks like everythings back the way it was, which is the only way it should ever be.	Can I bring my laser pointer?
Bart, that creepy kids here!	Hey, Milhouse! Oh, whats this?
Hey, Milhouse! Oh, whats this?	Psycho Cycle Conversion Kit?! Oh, wow, this will look great on my bike.
Thanks for the tassels. My mom can wear these on her boobs at work.	Hey, give those back.
Gentlemen first gear!	Oh man, I sure wish I had a ten-speed bike.
A ten-speed bike?! What did your mother say?	She said yes.
Yeah, the kitchen ladys right -- no new bike while your old one still works.	I see. So if my old bike didnt work, I would automatically get a new one?
What the Halle Berry?	Yes!
Yes!	My bike! My crappy, crappy bike.
Son, would you like to ride your new bike out of the store?	Can I, for true?
Ill assemble it myself.	Dad, no! Think of the bike.
I can make a bike. I made you.	Yeah, great workmanship.
Bikes over there.	You actually did it! Youre the coolest, Dad!
No one does this to Dolph! No one!	Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.	Im riding a unicycle with my pants down. This should be every boys dream.
Hey, it didnt fall apart.	Smash this six pack!
Smash this six pack!	Awesome! I gotta tell Milhouse.
Like a dog. Or a snowman!	Ashes to ashes... dust to dust... weve gotta go fight some robots.
Cmon, Homer. How long does it take to go to the bathroom?	Huh?
Huh?	Dear Bart...
...Id love to be with you, but I just remembered an old army buddy has come to town. Will meet you later. Love, Dad.	Well, I wish Homer was here.
Well, I wish Homer was here.	But dont worry. Ive got a name all picked out for you.
But dont worry. Ive got a name all picked out for you.	Chief Knockahomer, lets win this one for Dad!
Its the only way to talk to bullies.	...then Knockahomer did three victory laps and pretended to drink a beer!
Well, if you ever want to see a mailbox shoot a boy, thats about as close as youre gonna get.	Dad, it was so great -- Knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!
Not so rough, Bart. Daddy cant handle so much love right now.	This robots the greatest thing youve ever done for me. I cant believe youve never seen him fight.
Well, Ive been busy, son. They really need me over at the nuclear plank.	Well, the next match is Saturday. Can you come then?
Ladies and gentlemen... eh, who am I kidding, just gentlemen... join us next week for our title bout, when Knockahomer will try to unseat five time defending champion... Smashius Clay, a.k.a. Killhammad Aieee!	Our robot can kick that robots ass! Right Dad? Dad?
There it is! That thing that makes us respect Bart!	You guys are just in time. My dads about to tell me something important about our robot.
Okay Ive been studying Frinks robot, and Ive discovered he has one small weak spot.	Uh-oh. His weak spot is now his strongest point.
B-R-L-F-Q SPELLS MOM AND DAD / WELL THAT AINT TOO BAD, CAUSE THATS MY BOY...	I like you too, Dad.
I like you too, Dad.	You look a little sluggish out there, boy. Id better open you up.
You look a little sluggish out there, boy. Id better open you up.	Dad?!
Bart, Im sorry -- I could never build a robot this awesome. Im a fraud.	So, you fought all those robots?
Affirmative.	That is so cool!
You really think so?	Yeah! Any Poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life, even though youre the sole provider for a family of five! I am the luckiest kid in the world.
He knows just how I like my martinis... full of alcohol.	Go! Go! Go! Nows your chance!
Bart, all that button ever did was send a mild electric shock up my backside.	Why did you make it do that?
Son, did you ever suspect it was me?	Well, you did disappear a lot, but I have gone whole summers without seeing you.
Im gonna go up to the fourth floor where the books are.	Im gonna taunt the Ph.Ds.
Im gonna taunt the Ph.Ds.	Hey guys, I heard an assistant professorship just opened up!
Maybe on planet ZooZoo.	Hey, I think its cool. I can defibrillate Lisa!
If Dad ever reads that book, hes gonna be so humiliated.	Hell never read it.
What if they make it into a movie?	Hell never see it.
What if they parody it on Mad TV?	Were doomed.
Dads gonna catch Flanders, just like the end of Moms book.	Oh yeah. How does that go again?
Books? Books are for squares. Were now a multi-media learning center for children of all ages, but mostly bums.	Ay carumba!
Dont kill them, theyre my friends!	Oh cmon. Cant we at least have one pity scalp?
And today, Lewis promise has been fulfilled.	What is that, a quarter?
Bart, what famous historical figure do you want to write about?	Iunno. The boogeyman?
Cmon, Bart -- we can make this fun. Historys like an amusement park, except instead of rides, you have dates to memorize.	Mom, everyone who ever lived is boring.
Boring? Is there anything boring about a bad-ass rocker who lived fast and died young?	I know theres a catch, but tell me more.
Bart Simpson, be quiet.	Hey, that wasnt me, that was Milhouse?
This blows. Lets sneak off.	Wander away from the group? Man, youve been huffin from the Bart bag.
No, Walters been cool. Bart, I gotta say something, and its not easy.	Well, if its not easy, dont do it. Thats how I got where I am.
Then lets just say... I dont care what people think of me anymore.	You mean up until now you did care? Then why did you wear that tutu to school last week?
Circle gets the square!	TV sure has come a long way, huh Milhouse?
Im moving.	What?
My mom got a job in Capital City.	Capital City? You cant move that far, youre my best friend. Whats your Mom making? Ill match it!
Its too late, Bart. My Moms already transferred her 401K.	Nooo!
Its gonna be tough to be peppy today.	Tell me about it.
Oh Bart, Im sure its hard to lose your best friend.	You mean Milhouse? Funny little guy. Afraid of the dark. And the light. Now I got new friends. Guys who get me.
You mean Milhouse? Funny little guy. Afraid of the dark. And the light. Now I got new friends. Guys who get me.	Theres one right now.
Who is it? Is it Ralph?	It is not Ralph.
Hi, Bart! My nose makes its own bubble gum!	Just get in here.
I found you, Bart!	Ralph, were playing checkers.
What up, B?	Milhouse? Is that you?
Yeah, I gave my look some new flava. Suck it in!	Uh, maybe later.
What up, M-life?	Milhouse, this isnt you.
Now, please let me give you a wedgie in front of these guys.	No way!
Bart honey, its a nice day. Why dont you play outside?	Outside? Thats where me and Milhouse played.
Shut up, its a serious problem.	Lis, you are so dead.
Lis, you are so dead.	Im gonna hit you so hard, Ill kill your whole family.
Bart, youre in my family.	Shut up!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!	All right.
We cant jump this ditch.	Sure we can. But let me go first. Everyone knows youre the future of this family.
Thats not true, Bart. Mom and Dad value us equally, and... oh, youre right. Kay, go ahead.	Geronimo!
Geronimo!	Just forget everything you know about gravity.
But I know so much about it.	Just do it.
Ooh, were like Howard Carter discovering the Temple of Tutankhamen.	Or like when I discovered the schools Xerox code. One, four, seven. Just sayin it makes my butt feel warm again.
Pictographs! Bart, this is a Native American burial mound.	Look! Hes pickin his nose.
Hey, we shouldnt tell anyone we were here. This place should be our special secret!	Okay, shake.
Okay, shake.	Psyche!
Bart, theres spiders in your hair.	Thats what you call commitment to a bit.
The Mound Builders worshiped turtles, as well as badgers, snakes, and other animals.	Thank God weve come to our senses and worship a carpenter who lived two thousand years ago.
Hey, Bart, I borrowed my uncles pellet gun. Wanna go shoot Apu?	Oh, that does sound fun.
Oh, that does sound fun.	But not today. I think Im just gonna hang out at home.
You did not.	I know a guy who did.
Who?	You dont know him. He lives in Russia.
Well, Im glad to be back. Those Cap City kids dont think Im cool anymore. We were having a sleepover, and a robber came and wet my bed. Then he folded the bed back into the couch...and disappeared into the night.	I knew youd blow it. Now let me show you that mound.
You told him our secret?!	Hey, hes my best friend.
Oh. I see how it is.	Great. Then were all cool.
Well, its nice you have your best friend back.	You should hang with us sometime, Lis.
Mmm-hmm... I think Ill go to bed now.	Whats wrong?
Hoo boy, are you in trouble.	Whatre you talkin about?
Look, just because Milhouse is gone doesnt mean you have to pretend to be my friend.	Oh cmon, Ill roll the dice for you.
Oh cmon, Ill roll the dice for you.	...three, four, five, chance. Pick up a card.
What? Really?	Yep. Pick up another one.
But its not my turn.	Im trying to do something nice, you dink. Pick up a card.
Bart will defend you when other kids call you a nerd. No one calls me a nerd.	Trust me, that is a valuable card. Pick up another.
Oh Bart, thats really sweet.	Just because I have Milhouse back, doesnt mean I havent learned a few things about being a brother.
I think Im gonna use this card right now.	Aw, do I have to?
Wheres the ee-yow?	All yours, Homer.
You didnt sit on the toilet!	Didnt have to, Im a dude.
Butt on bowl, little man!	Hey, my-my pants arent down!
The fast track begins at birth.	Did we ever turn off that shower nozzle?
Im taking you all out for tacos!	Yay!
Philippa, I think you should come in here. Your baby is brilliant. Why, she could already teach at Florida State.	Go, Maggie!
All our children are smart. Some are just smarter than the others.	Welcome to The Others.
Im a mess. I cant believe Im jealous of a baby.	Hey, Im jealous of her, too. When youre a baby, you spend all day just rollin around on the floor. Boy, I miss that.
This may shock you... but youre both right.	Maggie! The red button... Hit the red button!
Its a movie version of a cartoon family you can see for free on TV.	But they stretched out the plot and added a wildebeest... from the hood!
What Would Jesus View?	Refresh my memory. These dweebs are with us why?
Must be the pipes. What do you think, Bart?	I think youre on your own, toots!
Let me explain. I was an internet billionaire.	Say no more.
No way! Hes an annoying sneak whos out to steal my wife.	Come on, Dad. With his brains and your musky smell, Ive got a full male role model.
He tried once, but he got confused and thought the book was real. Hes still looking for that chocolate factory. It consumes him.	Hey, Mom. Can I sleep over at Milhouses?
I thought you were playing catch with Artie.	Yeah, but after the ice cream man cut up his credit card, he got a little depressed.
Look Maggie, its a pop up! Daddys made a shiv. Can you help him ice Johnny Shakes, the jailhouse stoolie?	Hey, let me read it to her. Johnnys friends get some payback on daddy while hes sleeping...
Hey, let me read it to her. Johnnys friends get some payback on daddy while hes sleeping...	Daddys on fire. Daddys not on fire. Daddys on fire. Daddys not on fire. Daddys on fire...
I miss you guys so much. The smell of Marges pork chops... the way you kids kiss my owies when I go boom... This place has become like a prison to me!	Hey Dad, maybe thisll cheer you up. Why you little...
Im so happy to be getting my husband back.	And Im happy to listen to F.M. ninety-five point three. Home of Boomer and the Diz!
Bart!	Chill out, Mom. They gave me this hat.
Yes! Finally!	Amendments? Regulatory agencies? What the fark-bot?
Star system Trebulon Prime...?	Whoa, mama. Finally, some action!
The decision is final -- tabled, this motion is. Or is it?	That sucked!
Thats it. From now on Im not looking forward to anything. Oh my God, tomorrow theres a two-for-one sale on piano benches! I cant wait!	I feel so ripped off by that crappy movie, Im gonna chip a big hole in the floor.
That was you!?	A letter, huh? Okay Lis, get this down.
A letter, huh? Okay Lis, get this down.	Dear Randall Curtis, your movie stunk smelly butt. I am fine. Sincerely...
Dear Cosmic Wars fan, Im glad you loved my film?! Heres a photo of your favorite new character, Jim-Jam Bonks. May the power be on your side, Randall Curtis. He ignored our criticisms!	Were gonna have to track Randall Curtis down and make him listen to us.
Cmon Bart, heres our chance.	But the breads still dancing!
We come from the real world.	And were here to tell you that your movies have lost their way.
Well, now I know youre crazy.	Wait, before you have us killed, hear us out.
I drank this much!	Moms not gonna like this.
Wow... Mom and Dad sure are having fun.	Hey, as long as theyre not hurting anybody.
The best part is, I dont have to ask your father where he was all night, because I was there!	Why are your keys in my scrambled eggs?
Silent anger the cornerstone of a successful marriage.	Cool, guns.
Cool, guns.	Die, happy couples--
Thats not a toy, son. Its a bar code reader. It registers wedding gifts.	Bull-honky.
No, not bull-honky. A couple uses the gun to select gifts they want for their wedding.	Wow.
If youll excuse me, Im going to the employee lounge to finish my Shasta.	Name of groom...
A fake wedding. Thats what I call chutzpah.	Yeah, Im gonna scam this town out of so many presents. And what I dont use, Im gonna return... for store credit!
So, you thought youd pull a fake wedding, eh? Youre under arrest.	Cmon Chief, it was just a prank. Would some flatware make things right?
Bart Simpson, I hereby sentence you to six months at the Springfield Juvenile Correctional Facility.	Juvie?! Please Judge, you cant... I-Ill do anything! Ill squeal on my dad -- hes been up to bad things. Crap youVE never even thought of.
Just because youve done time in juvie doesnt mean the world has given up on you. See for yourself the exciting careers that wait for you upon your release.	These are all fast food jobs.
They cut all the good parts!	Ive lost everything I loved.
Dont forget to buy your photos!	Ill just hang out next to girls juvie.
Ill just hang out next to girls juvie.	Hello, ladies.
If youre gonna pick on someone, why dont you pick on someone much bigger than you with a gun?	Dad?!
I sure am. Here you go, son. I brought you a lollipop from the guards lounge.	Not so tough now, huh?
Love you.	Uh, this lollipops really for everybody.
Okay, heres my rules. Hands at ten and two, no eye contact, and I dont wanna hear how pretty I look.	Dont worry, you wont.
Talk to the union.	Im gettin out in two weeks. Why would I want to break out with you?
Oh, forget it.	Well, you do look pretty in the moonlight.
Hey, Im only stickin with you til I get these chains off. And if we get caught, Im tell em this was your idea.	Yeah? Why would they believe you?
That mean boy he dragged me out of the dance I didnt want to go, but he was too strong!	But youve got twenty pounds on me!
And then he said I was fat!	Im screwed.
You bet you are. Now as long as were together, I expect you to be a man.	But I have to wizzle.
Fine.	I miss prison.
Get bent. I pushed Snow White over the parapet at Disneyland.	Oh man. Did she live?
Yeah, but its not a good life.	Gina, before we get any closer, theres something you need to know about me. I think girls are icky-pants.
Bart, I cant believe you dont know this, but theres no such thing as cooties, cootie shots, cootie force-fields, or cootie insurance.	But State Farm took my money!
But State Farm took my money!	When we split up, where are you gonna go?
Dont worry -- my familyll hide me til the heats off.	Wow, your parents are cool!
Wow, your parents are cool!	Oh man, theres a line.
Bart, Im gonna miss you so much.	Hey, the next time my Mom asks me to help around the house, I could come live with your family.
Whats up? Dont you want to get back to that awesome family of yours?	What are you crying about? How cool they are?
What are you crying about? How cool they are?	Oh, I know youre sad now, but surely your incredible family will cheer you up.
No, I dont! Theyre imaginary... like your brain!	I understand.
You dont understand anything!	Youre such a psycho!
Mamas boy!	Future skank!
Finally, on a personal note, Mrs. Krabappel and I are to be joined in holy wedlock...this Saturday. Well be honeymooning at Lake Shelbyville Lodge, Cabin Thirty-two, Room Three. And we do not wish to be disturbed.	Way to go, Mrs. K! You finally hooked the Skinfish!
It looks good... but Im not gonna celebrate til hes gaffed, gutted, and hanging in my trophy room. Ha!	We have the same dream, maam.
Dont worry, Ive got a man on the perimeter.	Cowabunga One to Fat Load.
This is Fat Load. Id like to request a new codename.	Denied.
Okay, Fat Load here.	Here comes the bride. Repeat. Here comes the bride.
Im sorry, Seymour. I cant marry someone who doesnt want to be with me.	We got a runner. Snipers, take your shot.
Ill be there. Will you?	Mom, what are you doin here? Did our house burn down? Whoa, thatd be cool.
And the castrati?	The what now?
MS. KRABAPPEL / A SAD PRINCIPAL / IS DESPERATE AND NEEDY / IF YOU COME HOME / I WONT DIE ALONE / AND THATS WHAT ID PREFER...	UH-PLEE-EE-EE-EEASE / SETTLE FOR SEYMOUR / SO PLEE-EE-EE-EEASE COME BACK TO THE DORK
Forget you. Edna and I are in love. Were doing everything together. Breakfast, bath, and then the Bi-Monthly Science Fiction Convention. Enjoying.	The Bi-Mon Sci-Fi Con?!
Youve heard of it? Is it romantic?	Hey, women have put out just to get out of there.
Sure, Im happy to give anyone my autograph, anytime or anywhere on the street, in a store, or on my private property. But why be happy with just an autograph? What about an original sketch or snippet of my hair? And dont forget to pull my beard. They say its good luck!	Look -- there they are!
Hands off my fiancÃ©, wide ride!	Why are you dressed like Catwoman?
Water?	Thank you, Nelson. Anyone else?
Hot sauce?	Kearney, that could blind someone. You get an A.
Kearney, that could blind someone. You get an A.	Now, for a practical demonstration. First we load the ordnance...then select the target.
Now, for a practical demonstration. First we load the ordnance...then select the target.	Hmm, not Otto -- hed drive us off a cliff.
Off a cliff? That would solve everything!	Bingo.
Were staying at the Dayton Arms Hotel. It got three Diamonds from Five Diamond magazine!	Please dont make us go. If you make me get on that plane, Ill give myself diarrhea! I know how!
All right, kids, you dont have to go. But I insist we do something tonight as a family. Well play board games, put photos in an album, measure how much youve grown...	What is your deal, anyway?
Son, seeing sappy movies with a lady has certain payoffs.	Like what? Theyll do something with you that they hate?
What do you say about a 25-year-old girl who died?	I say bury her before she starts to smell.
Bart!	The man asked a question.
Bart, stop fooling with the remote!	Lisa made me! With a witchs spell!
Its called Wicca, and its empowering!	Wiccas a Hollywood fad!
Were alone now.	Youre never alone in this crapshack!
Somethings fishy. Theyre not in Dayton, theyre somewhere fun.	Were not enough fun for them? Well, I know how to find out where they are.
I cant go to Miami -- Im expecting calls from telemarketers!	Youll love it -- its full of sexy old widows who dont want to die alone.
Lets go find Mom and Dad!	First lets slap on some Band-Aids so they feel really bad for ditching us.
Those horn-dogs -- they ditched us again! You know what this means?	We have a free hotel room in Miami for two days?
No. Were gonna follow them across this great land, making sure they dont have one moment of fun.	And I have a card that can take us anywhere they go.
Im sorry, were not supposed to give out passengers itineraries.	I understand... Hey, whats that crazy girl doin?
The hell you are!	So, Mom and Dad are going to Atlantic City...but their luggage isnt. And Homers getting the low-fat meal.
Busted!	You guys lied to us!
You probably do this all the time! This whole family is built on a tissue of lies and romance!	Yeah, its a tissue... covered in blood and boogers!
Sure, we lied. We lied so we could spend a single night as a married couple without worrying about you kids!	Those days are over! Give it up!
You win, kids. Just sleep here tonight and well all go back to Springfield tomorrow.	Great! What do you wanna play?
Yeah, I cant sleep. Maybe we should give Mom and Dad a break. You know, go spend the day in an amusement park so were out of their hair.	Yeah, I agree. I mean, you are pretty annoying.
I guess the hunt was more fun than the catch.	Hey, I just zinged you.
When you grow up Ill be outside.	Im grown up, Im grown up!
Yeah.	What did those women expect? When you sign a contract with Fox, you know youre gonna be betrayed and humiliated.
How about a bite of the worlds biggest Brussels sprout?	Eww.
Lets see how your sisters doing in the place-setting competition.	Place-setting? How is someone so lame related to a hot tamale like me?
Aw, hey, lets turn that frown upside down.	Dad, I feel like Im gonna throw up.
Whats wrong, son?	Comic Book Guy made me pay for these comics he said I smudged. But I didnt even touch em!
Richie Rich Incorporates In Delaware, Easy to Believe Tales, Supergirl vs. the Glass Ceiling, The Green Listener...	He was just trying to unload these crappy comics on a helpless kid.
No, Pie Man! Dont do it!	Cmon, Pie Man, hit him! Thats the only reason anyone came to this stupid thing!
Wherever injustice shows its ugly face, I will be there! For I am the Pie Man!	And wherever Pie Man is, the Cupcake Kid will not be far behind.
I dont understand this game, Bart. How come we have to rake your lawn, while you just get to sit there?	Because Im it.
Because Im it.	Now, whoever finishes first gets a lemonade...
Yay!	...for me.
Hey, guys.	Uh-oh. Girls. You guys need your cootie shots.
Well, I hate this job, but I love the health plan.	Okay, ladies. Dont you have a poodle to dress up?
Fine, well go. Well find some other way to entertain our boy-crazy cousin who thinks youre cute.	I wouldnt mind pushin that in the mud.
Stop it, Homer! Theres only one way to settle this -- in Simpson family court.	What the hells that?
Mr. Simpson, do you think its appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?	Do you think it was appropriate to bet against your sons little league team?
Permission to treat this witness as hostile.	Homer, Ill bet when you were ten you were stealing beers, kissin girls and tippin dinosaurs.
Why? Because I only kissed one girl in my whole life? Thats still one more than you.	Ive kissed three girls.
Iron my hair? Thats what Leslie Uggams does!	Leslie who?
I cant believe you stood Mom up.	Face it, Lis -- men are dogs. The worse we treat you, the more you want us.
Thats not what dogs do.	Ha ha! You said dog doo!
Uh, I think well go to bed now.	What are you doing? If they fight in front of us, we might get new bikes!
Whos ready for a kitten?	I am!
This whole morning has been wonderful. Too wonderful.	Youre right, this is it. Theyre selling us to be crash test dummies.
Children, you should be grateful you live in a country where childhood diseases have been practically...	KaratÃ©!
And when youre done, Ive got more lollies!	No thanks. I already helped myself.
No thanks. I already helped myself.	See ya later, inoculator!
Now, that wasnt so bad, was it Bart? You know, sometimes the fear of some...	Whoa, somethings wrong! Ah, ah, I cant hear!
Mornin Willie!	Hey, fellas! My hearings back.
I THINK YOU SHOULD STAY HOME FROM SCHOOL TOMORROW.	But Mom... tomorrows the big donkey basketball game.
But Mom... tomorrows the big donkey basketball game.	The kids are gonna play the teachers!
The kids are gonna play the teachers!	Donkey Basketball? Now Ive heard everything! Unlike you!
Hm, tough crowd. Uh, would everyone just rise for our National Anthem?	Hey, donkey, want a carrot?
Hey, donkey, want a carrot?	Psyche!
When you insult the flag, you insult my flag tattoo!	Uh-oh.
Congratulations, traitor.	Thank you. And let me say I missed your sweet, sweet voices.
No, no, no, let her finish.	Look, what should I say to make people not hate me?
Just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier. But dont go in the bathrooms, theyre filthy.	Dad, I am going on a talk show. I have to say something!
Talk about boats! Then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you dont.	But I dont hate this country.
Im Nash Castor and its time to butt heads. Bart Simpson, what do you hate most about this country? Is it the freedom?	Nash, Ive realized something. Im the worst kid in the world, and the last thing I deserve is forgiveness. But with a little help from Jesus and our fighting men and women overseas--
Lord, give us the courage to worship the American flag. Be it on a car, a belt buckle, or on your holy person.	Ay carumba!
Its not a jail, its a reeducation center.	Well, where do you think we are?
OKAY, KIDS SHOW OFF YOUR PIPES...	AMERICANS ARE / BRAVE AND LOYAL / SO CMON JERKS, GIVE US YOUR OIL...
OKAY, KIDS SHOW OFF YOUR PIPES...	Dad, why are you still singing that stupid song?
Yes.	No.
My poem has become an elegy. An elegy no one will ever hear.	Well, at least some good came out of today.
Bart, youre grounded for a year.	Ill just pay the fine.
Tomorrows? I hadnt thought about publishing more.	You better -- Ive already sold a bunch of subscriptions. How do you think I got these swell prizes!
Nice work, Bart! But give him a runny nose. I want the readers to gag on their morning cup of Joe.	Snot a problem, Chief.
Dont call me Chief.	Sure thing, Jerk.
I guess were down to just me.	Take the sob sister act somewhere else -- youre standin in my light!
Bart, youre staying!	Lis, Ive learned a valuable lesson here the pen is mightier than the flaming bag of poop.
Hello? Octopuses? Im done.	Am I the only one here whos in horrible pain?
What a delicious meal! I feel like Im going to burst.	Cool! Im vomit.
Hyper-galactic!	Wait a minute. I dont have a family anymore!
Cause I had a vision of myself... shooting your father.	In this neighborhood, who hasnt?
Science Officer!	Security!
Bart, what are you doing?	Takin a whiz.
To get Maggie in time, well have to catch a ride on a nerve impulse -- the bodys information super-highway!	Learning is cool!
Bart, where did you get those?	Theres an open house next door. Theyre giving out cookies and business cards!
Theres an open house next door. Theyre giving out cookies and business cards!	Check it out, Im a business jerk!
What man would want you now?	Whoa -- Playdudes!
Hey, the lady in this picture is hot. She can calamine my hives anytime.	Thats Congresswoman Bella Abzug.
Ciao Bella.	The grown-ups in this magazine are pretty cool.
The grown-ups in this magazine are pretty cool.	I could make the treehouse look like this. Then we could have orgies, whatever they are.
When Virginia Woolf wrote every woman needs a room of ones own, she must have been talking about the kitchen.	Whats the first thing youre gonna make in your new kitchen?
So, when do they start singing?	Well, the Playdude Advisor says this music will get a stewardess to give you a layover.
Your mothers about to show us her new recipe.	Outtasight! Lay it on me, Mama.
Its deep fried cookie dough with meringue buns, cherry ketchup and caramel mustard.	Its dessert, but its hot dogs, so its good for you!
Haw haw! Bart looks different today.	Ah Nelson, your debonair wit reminds me of a young Mort Sahl.
Guh?	Listen up, ring-a-ding-dingers. Im throwin a little sip n quip at the Playdude Treehouse. Saturday night, at the top of the ladder. Be there or be square.
I wanna be a triangle.	Youre not invited.
Whos that adult?	Hey, it wouldnt be a Playdude party without James Caan.
Hey, Bart, me and Mrs. Krabappel uh, were gonna play some backgammon, if you know what I mean.	I dont, but I hope you win.
Maybe I was a little hard on him. Oh, well. Bart, I know a father has no right to pry into the life of his ten-year-old son. But whats going on up here?	Im just spreadin the Playdude philosophy. Hi-fis, Norman Mailer, gettin some...
Uh-um... What do you think some is?	Uh... toys?
Do you know what a boob is?	Oh yeah.
Good. Thatll save us some time. Okay... why do you think your mother and I sleep in the same bed?	Because were poor?
I guess Dad has to be my hero now.	Not if you knew what hes been doing.
Every Simpson starts with a circle. Daddy has one big circle here... then a smaller one up here... two big, sexy circles for eyes... one macho muzzle... and a snappy new outfit. Hm, Im lookin good... ooh, cuffs... yeah... and for some reason, my hair and ear form an M and a G.	Party! Party! Party! Party!
Oh, I love to see my man eat.	Check it out, Homes. You said if I ever got a hundred on a test, youd throw me a party.
Check it out, Homes. You said if I ever got a hundred on a test, youd throw me a party.	Theres my hundred -- wheres my party?
Nice try, loser. I bet you made up a fake test.	Nope, its real -- check out the watermark.
Yes, its something, dear.	See, its all legit. Now make with the party.
Bart really did get a hundred. I gave a test on state capitals, but I forgot to roll up the map. Everyone got a hundred.	I win! P-A-R-T. Par-tee!
Barts my bestest boyfriend.	Oh Mom, this guest list sucks.
Its the best I could do on such short notice.	Wheres Milhouse?
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck duck, duck, duck, duck, duck...	Say goose, you stupid freak!
Say goose, you stupid freak!	Mom, this was the worst party ever.
Well, I guess its just you and me, Bart!	Mom, after that lame party you threw, Id rather hang out with thunder-thighs here.
Whaddya say? Itll be BLAM! Bart, Lisa And Mom. Huh?	Mom, when I want lame and needy, Ill call Milhouse. No offense.
I know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy and anti-feminist... but thats what a fat girl would say!	Lis, look!
Thanks, Dingus... I mean, maam.	My mother... my bully... my God!
Im your new roommate. I call top bunk.	But its a single bed.
I said top bunk!	Mom, the reason God invented deadbolts is to keep people like Nelson out of your house.
Bart, eat up or youll be late for school!	Im not hungry.
PAPA ARE YOU NEAR ME? / PAPA, CAN YOU HEAR ME? / PAPA, CAN YOU HELP ME NOT BE FRIGHTENED? / LOOKING AT THE SKIES I SEEM TO SEE / A MILLION EYES WHICH ONES ARE YOURS?...	Ive gotta do something about him.
Thanks for finding my Dad, Bart. And thanks, lady, for making me feel good about myself.	So, now that youre happy again, I guess you wont beat me up at school anymore.
Cmon, boy. Take your pill.	Mom, the dog wont take his medicine!
Shes from Springfield! I knew her in high school.	I didnt think anyone successful came from Springfield.
Marge! I figured out a way we can get in on this Quimby lawsuit! Bart, go ahead.	Mayah Quimby is my er ah, fathah. Give me one million dollahs!
Chloe left town as soon as Barney proposed. I wouldve followed her, but my plans changed when God brought me a wonderful little boy... Bart, stop that!	This isnt what it looks like.
Ive never disobeyed Mom before. Is this a step Im really willing to take? I dont know. The more I think about it, the...	Thinking is for losers!
Bart! Thanks for helping me make up my mind.	Thanks for cushioning my fall.
All right. But while Im gone, boy, you think about what you did.	What did I do?
Extra charge for warm-ups!	Mom, I wanna be just like you. I mean the lava part, not saving Lisa.
Youre in big trouble, mister. Im bleeding!	Theres no cut on your cheek...
Theres no cut on your cheek...	Whered the blood come from?
Whered the blood come from?	Hey, I got a loose tooth.
Eww, gross! I bet you cant twist it.	Of course I can twist it, Im great.
Thats the money tooth -- I heard the Tooth Fairy pays triple for it.	Then lets hurry up and rip it out of my head.
Oh, Bart, honey Im so sorry.	No problem.
I wouldnt say that.	Um-huh.
Um-huh.	God, please give your daughter the Tooth Fairy the strength to carry my cash, and the integrity not to dip her wand in the till.
Maybe when the Tooth Fairy saw it was your last baby tooth, she realized youre not a little boy anymore. So she gave you a grown-up gift.	Im not gonna grow up!
Oh yes you are. Why, in the right light, youre starting to get your own muzzle.	I thought it was chocolate milk!
Yeah, thats how it starts.	Nooo!
Im still a kid. And what do kids love? Kid stuff, like this.	Vroom vroom. Vroom vroom... Vroom, vroom.
Whatcha realizing, jerk?	That Im not a kid anymore.
Well, theres one thing no one can take away my childlike imagination.	Sergeant Activity, your mission is to scale the icy walls of Mount Bloodkill!
Youd be surprised -- if youre a nonsmoker, it can cost just a few dollars a month.	Whats happening to me? Maybe Im not a kid anymore.
So Eden sank to grief, / So dawn goes down to day, / Nothing gold can stay. Yarr.	Hey, Sea Captain.
Givin your toys a Viking funeral, eh?	I really dont want to talk about it.
If you change your mind, I wont be farrr.	Thanks, but--
Bart, if you dont get up now, good luck getting a pancake. Dads pulled his chair right up to the stove.	Lis, I think Im having a midlife crisis.
If youre feeling depressed, do what I do and write something. A novel, a play...	Or, I could write something thats not gay.
Bart, someone wrote something cynical on your shirt!	Um-hmm.
Let me wash it off.	Leave me alone -- this expresses my rage at the machine.
She still has a lot of her original strawberry scent.	Forget it. My attitude isnt for sale! What am I saying? Of course it is!
Do you have a T-shirt with Calvin peeing on Hobbes?	Sorry.
And it looks like one of the lights in your sneakers is out.	Come on, Chief. I cant afford to pay protection to you and Nelson.
Proud Nubian Princess. Score!	Its no fair -- I just started and Im out of business.
Why dont you go legit and sell your shirts in stores?	But Im just a kid.
Youre a kid no longer, Bart. Youve become a man.	Hey, youre right, I am.
Ill just leave these brochures!	So how can I get my shirts in stores?
I bet you could find a distributor at the Springfield Novelty Expo.	Thats right -- its tomorrow!
It works!... If blue is the color for unimpressed.	T-shirts! Come order my homemade T-shirts. My Mom thinks theyre good.
T-shirts! Come order my homemade T-shirts. My Mom thinks theyre good.	Hey!
The names Goose Gladwell.	Of Gooses Gags and Gifts?
Thats right! Ive got twenty stores in thirty states. And I want to sell your shirts in most of them!	You really think my shirts will sell?
Ive been reading this magazine for years, but I never dreamed my son would be on the cover.	Its Goose!
Hello, Simpsons.	Ooh!
Bart, can I ask you an important question?	How much?
Twenty-nine ninety-nine.	Heres fifty.
Woo hoo!	Thats your donut money too, mister!
No problem. Bart, I need two hundred dollars.	Dad, the bills only a hundred.
...to the Disney Company, which will turn each one into a movie.	Really? How much money do I get?
Whats the matter, boy?	Goose Gladwell ripped me off and theres nothin I can do about it. Im just a stupid kid.
Well, Im just glad were back to me being the father and you being the son.	Are you sure that thing could really explode?
Theres more than one way to lose a tooth.	Hey, idiot. Youre fat, and your Moms naked on the internet. You also smell.
Mr. Burns acting nice? Thats odd. He must be up to something.	Lis, Mr. Burns is the sweetest, kindest man I know.
How many men do you know?	Basically him and Dad.
We just wanted to thank you. Because of the Xanax, Im not over-anxious about being a Simpson anymore. I am a little anxious about being on Xanax, but the Zoloft covers that nicely.	My Dad, the drug mule.
See you in Hell, document!	All right, Dad!
I win...	Thinner... thinner... thinner... thinner... too thin.
Thinner... thinner... thinner... thinner... too thin.	Better luck next time, Tommy - Virginia Beach.
Thanks, Moe.	Dad, Moms spending more time at Moes than you are.
Whats a cuckold?	Wheres Mom going with Uncle Moe?
Are you sure Mom and Dad want us to enter a European balloon race?	Sure, why not.
I know how to save this park -- Im gonna organize a charity carnival!	Uh, Mom? Looks like someone beat you to it.
Dammit! I never win anything! Ooh, heres something Im good at.	Yes!
Yes!	Check it out, Fat-wad! Im better than you, and Im only ten!
Easy... gentle...	Ay carumba!
Hello. Im Deion Overstreet.	The running back for the San Antonio Cow Skulls?!
Hes just being true to the Bible, which is pretty violent.	And sexy. King David stole someone elses wife... Mary Magdalene was a hooker...
Bart! How do you know these things?	Its all in this book.
And so ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the start of Super Bowl XXXIX! This brand new three hundred-million dollar stadium was completed just one short week ago, and is scheduled for demolition early next month. Americas priorities are a joke. Now, heres the kickoff!	Wow, all these people are gonna see Dads show.
This all-star concert, dubbed Murder 4 Life, features Da Glock Pointaz, Romeo Smoov, Queen Booty Shaykah, M.C. Champagne Millionaire, and Assault Weapons Magazines man of the year, Alcatraaaz.	Alcatraaaz is wide spread! Im talkin da junk!
Just what we need. Another lame suburban kid who loves rap.	So? You like the blues.
So? You like the blues.	Yes, but the blues are unpopular.
Yes, but the blues are unpopular.	Man, are you illin.
Rappers stopped saying illin twelve years ago.	Im keepin it real.
They stopped saying keepin it real three years ago.	Mom, Lisas dissin me!
Go to Hell.	Okay, what if I pay for it myself?
Fine, go nuts.	I love you, Dad.
Baggy britches? Loose-laced gym shoes? Are you going to a rap performance?	Hell yeah! Im representin at Murder 4 Life, know what Im sayin?
All too well. Rap music belongs in the rubbish bin. It encourages punching, boastfulness, and rudeness to hos.	Step off, Mom. Rap is the poetry of the streets.
Well, you are not going to any concert that promulgates stink talk.	But Dad already said I could go!
Son, your mother makes a very loud point...	But you said I could go if I paid for the ticket!
Dad, you completely sold me out!	Well, I paid for this ticket. That makes me an adult. Im going.
Oh no he didnt!	YOU CAN TRACE MY REMORSE TO ITS SUPER-SIZED SOURCE / A HUNGRY, HUNGRY HYPOCRITE NAMED HOMER OF COURSE / MY OLD MANS PATHETIC / DAMN IS HIS HEAD THICK / THE GAS FROM HIS ASS IS CARCINOGENIC / EVERY DAY I PRAY HIS DNA AINT GENETIC
Yknow downstairs I got a wax museum of famous movie monsters. Check it out if you want to get your fright on.	Jeepers! Its 50 Cent!
Yo B, I heard you throw down on stage. Wanna join my world tour?	Sorry, Fiddy. I have school tomorrow.
If thats true, hes gonna be like NWA -- Not Without Ass-welts.	Well, time to face my punishment like a man... Or, lie my way out of it like a kid.
This is no fun without Bart. He used to watch me while I did this.	I still do.
Bart! Are the kidnappers after you?	Well... some kidnappers might be after me. Its a big world. But in this case, I faked the whole thing.
Why? Are you mad at me?	No, its not about you.
Its never about me.	Look, I need a place to hide out til the heat is off.
Yello?	This is the kidnapper.
Please give me back my boy! I just want to tell him I love him one more time.	Mom, its me. Dont cry, Im okay.
Mom, its me. Dont cry, Im okay.	The kidnappers say if you worry too much... theyll kill me.
Okay, you made your point!	Gotta go!
Whats going on? I didnt know he was here! I swear!	Uh, Chief... is Milhouses Dad gonna be in trouble? Hes not really a bad guy.
Oh son!... Taking your tombstone back to the store will be the happiest thing Ive ever done.	Ay carumba!
Bart, two, three, four! You put my Dad in jail, flip, spin, twirl!	Milhouse, if you tell anyone, Ill tell the world you wet your pants watching Harry Potter.
I wasnt scared, I was just peeing.	Look, if you tell what I did, Ill get in trouble.
We dont need an Eddie.	Commissioner Wiggum, I need to confess something.
Is it that youre proud of me?	I lied about being kidnapped. The whole thing was a hoax.
Oh no, Bart please, you cant take this away from me. How would I explain it to Ralphie? That kid cant understand where the world goes when you close the drapes.	But... what about Milhouses Dad?
Give me a call sometime! Give me a call sometime! Here comes the panic!	People, please. The only way Lisa can bust me is if she finds someone who can prove I was at that rap show. And I know just where she can find that someone. Lets go cover our asses!
Aw nuts. Theyre gonna release that tape and our hoax will be exposed. Well, I guess Ill go back to Baltimore and sell ribbon with my Daddy. Ribbon! Get your ribbon! Great for presents!	Wait a minute. Why do we have to come clean? Nobodys been hurt. Everyones happier with the lie.
The way I was raised, by Mom, I learned the truth cant be swept under the rug.	Thats a very noble sentiment, Lisa. But for once in your life, cant you just be cool?
Some sucker will think hes getting beer, but hes really gonna get a face full of melon!	Shhh. Dont ruin the moment.
Nice try, boys. Now, as the Roadrunner said to the Coyote, meep meep!	Everyone in town is wise to us. We need someone new we can prank.
Everyone in town is wise to us. We need someone new we can prank.	Sweet. Fresh meat.
Hi, bean sprouts! The names Howell Huser. I travel the country gawkin and talkin, and I was hopin to take in your town.	We can show you around. If you dont mind a heapin helpin of local color.
Radioactivity?	That means its a place where we do radio... activities.
Yeah, get out, shamey!	I dont think well be hearing from him again.
Up next on the Soft News Network, lets hear from our own wide-eyed wanderer, Howell Huser.	Uh-oh.
Hey, what can I say? I love love.	Well, all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn.
Because shes bringing over someone very special. Her fiancÃ©e.	Is this one of those reality deals where a guy gets a million bucks for marrying Aunt Patty? But they have to honeymoon in a box full of snakes?
I thought you said Aunt Patty was just waiting for the right man.	As opposed to you, who grabbed the first blimp that floated by.
Correction. The first blimp that got her pregnant.	Seriously Dad, Im worried. You should go on a diet.
What am I not invited to this time?	Gay wedding. But I can get you in.
You can? Is there an open bar?	No, cash.
Well, thats the end of Dads wedding business.	Why?
Sure am!	See ya next fall.
You make those same stupid jokes every field trip!	Eh, you work in the business as long as I have, youre bound to repeat yourself.
Eh, you work in the business as long as I have, youre bound to repeat yourself.	See you next fall!
Ah, pre-modern man. If these wise warriors could speak, what would they tell us?	They left a message right here.
Actually carved into the rock. Nice work, Simpson.	Feel free to make a rubbing.
Whatever!	Check it out -- that frog has a nerd on its butt!
Bart, you are the meanest, nastiest little boy that ever lived.	Hey, theres a dog in the next car lookin at me. Hey, dog.
You dont even care how upset I am! But this time you have gone too far.	What are you gonna do, tell Mom and Dad? Theyre powerless figureheads.
Bart Simpson, this is your restraining order. From now on, you must stay at least twenty feet away from your sister.	Restraining order?! Bull spit! No piece of paper keeps me from whaling on my sister.
So, you see what happens when you dont obey your restraining order?	Yes, Chief Wiggum.
I always hoped we wouldnt be one of those restraining order families.	How am I supposed to know if Im twenty feet away?
Hey, this really works.	Homer, why did you put the screwdriver at the end?
A.m. kindergarten made the Bart doll. P.m. kindergarten made the Lisa. The point is, were not allowed to have you in this building.	Well, Ive never been one to break the law...
Well, Ive never been one to break the law...	So long, Seymour. Gimme a jingle sometime.
I will. But there is one place on school property that falls outside all laws of man or God.	No... you dont mean...
The smell is manure. And the drippins manure. Now turn to chapter one of Math Safari.	But were already on chapter seven.
Dios mio!	I cant take it anymore! Every time I try to relax, she-- ow, my neck!
I cant take it anymore! Every time I try to relax, she-- ow, my neck!	Cant I even finish my milk?
Bart, do you have anything to say?	My sister has no sense of humor. Im sure you understand. Its why you became a judge instead of finding a husband.
I have a husband!	What is he, blind and deaf?
Sorry, boy. This is the only place thats two hundred feet from Lisa but still on our property.	Its pretty scary out here, Dad. Dad?
Its pretty scary out here, Dad. Dad?	Well, I bet they miss me.
Bart, Lisa went over to Janeys. Quick, run inside and go potty!	Why should I go inside? The world is my toilet now.
Lis, just let me be!	Look in your heart. Im beggin ya. Look in your heart.
Im relinquishing the poke-pole.	What does that mean? Youre sharpening it?
What does that mean? Youre sharpening it?	Look in your heart. Im beggin ya. Look in your heart.
Im not sharpening it!	Are you putting feces on the tip?
Ive realized how much I missed you -- and I can see from this magnificent Lisa statue that you felt the same way.	Oh... uh... yeah. When youre right, youre right. Lets eat.
Bart, you were gonna burn the third nice thing youve ever done for me?	Well, you see... the fire represents... your musical ability?
Aww, Bart, I missed your lies... And I was kind of a pill. I guess.	Lisa... you just poked my feelings. Im sorry too.
Van Houten blows past Simpson. Hes got all the right moves...	And a fight breaks out!
Selma, what you experienced was a hot flash, an early symptom of menopause.	What the hells menopause?
That is quite an insult to your other children.	We understand, maam. Were pretty lousy kids.
Is there anything more fun than a nice Sunday drive?	Oh yeah, its great. Why dont we top it off by reading to old people?
Always nice to see him.	How did Dad get out of this snooze cruise?
Homie!	Time to open the envelope I gave you.
Compress his chest!	Im on it.
Kids, your mother and I have decided to take a little break from each other. While we deal with our issues, I plan to go on Motorhome Makeover and trick this thing out like a palace, not like that dump you live in. All I need is for someone to start a show called Motorhome Makeover.	I see. You were mad enough to leave our house, but not mad enough to leave our property? Thats my half-assed Dad!
Neat! When I sleep at Dads, I call this bed.	You can have it -- this ones way better.
Thats a bread compartment.	Youre a bread compartment!
Kids, come back in the house!	Oh, do we have to?
Ill have you know I could have married Sideshow Mel!	Boy, theyre really going at it. Do you think theyre gonna get divorced?
Hey, I know this is a crazy idea, but hear me out. What if we...	Take this back to the dealer?
How do you know thats their blimp?	Duh! Its Kamper Kong.
Well stop fighting, we promise!	Prove it!
Were not quite there yet, but weve opened up a dialogue!	Not good enough! Kiss!
Not good enough! Kiss!	French it up, lover boy!
Now pull over!	First, raise my allowance.
I see no kids. And we must get these season one Northern Exposure DVDs to Kahramanmaras.	Help us!
Oh! The famous Shelbyville Theater District! Can we see a play?	Play?! All plays suck, all the time, and always will, and everyone knows it!
Ill bet shes sneaking food from someplace else! Lets follow her!	Id rather follow the dog. I think hes up to something.
There you are, Smokey!	Snowball II has another family!
This is worse than when we thought Mom was having an affair. It turned out she was just going to the library to cry.	Now she just bottles up her misery like a normal mom!
What is it that they have that keeps Snowball coming back to their house?	Only one way to find out.
Only one way to find out.	My baby turtle crawled into your basement window.
Oh, you poor boy. Whats your turtles name?	Uh... apron, boobs-face?
And whats your name?	Uh... shoes, butt-back?
You forgot to take some brownies!	Thanks, Mother Dexter! Ill be back tomorrow.
Bart, why were you in there so long?	Lis, that place is great! They have a jukebox in the basement! And look at the trick they taught me!
Deal!	Are you watching? Are you watching?
Listen to me! This whole building is unsafe. They cut corners everywhere. People, its a death trap!	No Dad, you fell asleep in front of the TV watching The Towering Inferno.
No, you do. Youre gay for Moleman!	Youre gay for Moleman!
Where are we?	Youre gay for Moleman!
Would you like to see yourselves as teenagers?	No.
Hey, everybody. Bart, you are lookin crook-ed!	Hey Jenda, how bout some forehead?
Im tired of this. I wanna look at a different future.	Meh.
Bart, maybe you should listen to this.	Oh! Now I have to start over.
Once I home-invaded this Princeton dude, and he was like totally married.	Well, I guess an intensive four-year bachelor of arts program is the easiest way to get Jenda back.
Thats odd. You get into Yale and Lisa cant go anymore.	Hey, what can I say. I love learning.
And you will! At the age of eighty-three. You die one minute later.	And my brain is put in a...
Well Bart, I really appreciate what youre gonna do for me.	But what happens to our parents?
You dont know the half of it.	Oh, this sucks. I want to see Vice-President Cletus.
You know Homer, I let a lot of things slide, but when you cant keep a roof over your familys head, youre just not much of a father.	I was gonna have my classmates over for a homework party, but now my refreshments are ruined.
I was gonna have my classmates over for a homework party, but now my refreshments are ruined.	Goodbye, college!
High-five!	Eh, I got standards. I dont hand out high-fives like Chiclets.
Yay, Mom!	Zing!
Can we keep your dog? Please?	Keep my dog? Till when?
How you feeling, sweetie?	Hey Dad, remember when you said if I used a chainsaw unsupervised Id hurt myself? Well, you were wrong. I hurt someone else.
But thats not true, Bart saw him at the Builders Barn.	No I didnt, Dad.
No I didnt, Dad.	I saw you talking to yourself.
Well, thats a world of difference. Light me up, doc!	When youre gettin juiced, can you hold my turtle? I wanna bring him back to life.
Aw, what did he die of?	Iunno. He was dead when I found him.
You kids can relax. Your father is fine now.	Fine and dandy?
I see Ray too.	So do I.
Gee, I thought my vision was perfect. And here I was, worshiping false eyeballs.	Wait, wait, wait, wait. How come at Builders Barn I saw Homer talking to thin air?
Way to go, dude! Youre five cents away from an awesome beverage or snack.	Oh, Im outta money! Willie! You wanna buy my skateboard?
Bart, I spent all afternoon stuffing tuna fish into that steak. Have some.	No thanks -- the vending machines at school feed me now.
Bart, how can you laugh at that? You just had a heart attack!	Yeah, but what does not kill me makes me stronger. Wow, that was a lot of words -- I need some energy.
I talked to Dr. Hibbert today. He gave me a list of heart-smart foods.	Ko-ta-hay cheese?
Cottage cheese!	Yuck. From the looks of it, this cheese has already been eaten.
Aw honey, please take this seriously. When people used to ask me how you were doing, I said at least hes got his health. Now youve got nothing! Nothing! For me, please try a healthy vegetable.	Okay Mom, for you, Ill try.
You get better, son. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the library.	Where are you really going?
Intervention!!!	What the family?!
All this does is get me to normal.	Thank you, Krusty. Once again youve delivered an important message wrapped in entertainment. And Im so touched that all of you would take the time to eat my shorts, lame-os!
Thank you, Krusty. Once again youve delivered an important message wrapped in entertainment. And Im so touched that all of you would take the time to eat my shorts, lame-os!	Help! Kidnappers!
Theyre not kidnappers! Theyre professionally trained child-snatchers, who are taking you to a maximum-security fat camp.	Im not fat!
We know! Your side-fats startin to spill over to channels five and seven! I hope youre getting three paychecks.	Bart Simpson, Im just big-boned.
No such thing.	Growth spurt?
Doesnt exist.	This cant be legal!
Son, Im gonna tell you a story about a young man who came here and failed. Well, that is the story. I shouldnt call a sentence a story. Anyway, its you!	Look, Im really, really sorry. Now let me get that ice cream off your shoe.
Problem number thirty-five with America no universal healthcare. Number thirty-six no metric system. What is this, the time of Charlemagne? Answer me! Answer me now!	Oh, my God.
Yo, Im gonna cap a pop in your ass!	Im ending your vending, Dog.
Bart, what are you doing here?	I learned my lesson -- Mr. Spangler showed me the true cost of my junk food addiction.
But... youre still fat!	Not for long -- Im saying goodbye to Scammer and Z-Dog. Ive learned that even made-up corporate shills can lie to you.
Did you hear that Foxy, the Fox network Fox?	When I raged against the machine, money poured out.
Marge, Im giving birth to a food baby.	I feel like something crawled inside me and took a crap.
I brought you some weak tea and dry toast.	No fair, Lisa didnt get sick.
Looks like you guys are on the mend.	Yeah, cause were through with vegetables. From now on, Im only eating food that I know had a soul.
Thanks, Bart. Thats really sweet.	I think I puked up all of my meanness.
Ow!	Praise the Lord! Im on the road to recovery.
I cant believe I used to date him.	Lis, youre a shoo-in.
Theres no way Im gonna beat her.	Why? Just because she sings like Whitney Houston brought to life?
Homie, Im worried youre turning into some kind of super koo-koo stage mother.	Yeah. For once, couldnt you just turn into a good father? Would that be so hard?
Bart, you wanna go to the video arcade?	Hell, Ill even go shoe shopping.
Im not Mr. Simpson. That ship has sailed. Im Colonel Cool! And Im the Captain on this rocket to the stars.	So, are you a Colonel or a Captain?
Youre the boss.	What the Hell?
What the Hell?	Whoa!
You have?! Thats so nice!	What Lisas trying to say is... theres a new kids barbershop in the mall, and wed like to start going there.
Which side do you want your part on?	Left! Right! Stab! Stab! Stab!
But sweetheart, I have something they didnt have -- a good feeling about this.	Its all right, Lisa. Dont go. More Heaven for me.
Weve got school tomorrow.	Yeah, school.
Instead of video games they have weird free newspapers.	Mom, am I a butch or a fem?
I feel so much empathy for those villagers. They had to drink their own tears...	I was so bored I cut the ponytail off the guy sittin in front of us.
I was so bored I cut the ponytail off the guy sittin in front of us.	Look at me, Im a grad student. Im thirty years old and I made six hundred dollars last year.
Hey, a banner ad!	Sexy Slumber Party dot com?
If they are, they will see us explore our sexhood without restraint.	Hey, this is one of those dirty websites.
I coulda sworn I just heard someone shriek my name.	You heard nothing!
Why you little... Ill teach you to have a libido!	Dad, look whos in there!
Son, I need to pee, but I cant stop watching. Fetch me a bottle.	Cmon, Dad. Ive seen you hit the toilet from here.
Bart! Turn away from that screen and look out the window!	No problem-o.
Dont worry, Marge. Ive taken every precaution.	This is so humiliating.
My liege.	Whatm I gonna be? Black knight? Court ninja? Bart the Impaler?
Bart, youll be playing the village cooper.	What kind of a knight is that?
The kind of knight that makes barrels and isnt a knight. Ha!	Ay carumba.
Ay carumba.	Well, this stinks. But I bet Lisa got something even stupider.
Cooper! Thy staves are not flush!	Youll pay for this, my Queen.
Scurry, me beasties... nibble and gnaw at their overstuffed buttocks!	Milhouse! Dont open your mouth!
This is no accident.	Nice party, dink.
Bart, get your things. Youre leaving with me!	No way! I didnt do it! Unlike all the other stuff I told you I didnt do, which I did!
Bart, a school-sponsored Medieval festival is supposed to be the best day of a young girls life, and you ruined it. You deserve to be expelled.	I didnt do it! Mom, you believe me, dont you?
Bart, this could be a good new school... Oakwood Academy! Huh?	Mom, thats a school for the blind.
Class, we have a new student. Bart, would you like to introduce yourself?	Im Bart Simpson, ay carumba, do the Bartman, etcetera, etcetera.
In the old days wed use a ruler to deal with incorrigibles like you...	Thanks for the history lesson, sis.
These days we use a yard stick!	Ill show you, Ill move thirty-three inches away.
A yards thirty-six!	Now you tell me.
Now, think what it would be like if you had nails in your hands.	Well, I guess theyd help me hold the dictionaries up.
Wrong answer!	Stupid Catholic school. Suffering for my hip attitude... Im the real Jesus here!
So, its sacrilege youre spoutin then.	Whats it to you, Irish?
And thats how I came to the church.	Well, Im only here because I got blamed for a prank I didnt do.
Call me crazy, but I believe you.	You do?
Course I do. You know, lots of church-types started off as rotten little buggers. St. Augustine himself got his start stealing pears.	Stealing pairs of what? Hubcaps? Reeboks? Human eyes?
Its all in here -- see for yourself.	Cool.
Yeah, whatever. Now class, open your math books to the word problems of our Lord. Billy and Joseph start their penance at the same time. If each swear word brings a thousand years in Hell...	St. Sebastian was a pious Roman soldier...
St. Sebastian was a pious Roman soldier...	For preaching Christianity to the Romans, the Emperor Diocletian sentenced him to death by hail of arrows.
I wish Id gone to more orgies!	Whoa, this stuff is great! Its way better than the comics I get at the dentist.
Bart, Im glad you had fun, but I wouldnt get too into that Catholic church. With all the sitting and standing and kneeling, its like Simon Says without a winner!	Mom, thats blasphemy! Ill say a rosary for you.
Lets just change the subject. Bart, would you like to say grace?	Yesm. Anima Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto...
Homer, youre physically an adult, and what you do in the privacy of your own soul is your business. But I didnt change Barts diapers for five years to see him become a Catholic.	I thought there was a monster in the potty.
Then why did I drive through that barn?	Why did you guys have to take me away? Youre always nagging me to go to church, and now that I am, its the wrong one.
I just dont think your fathers the right person to pick out a religion for you.	Okay, Ill pick a religion for me. Judaism.
Okay, Ill pick a religion for me. Judaism.	DONT HAVE... A COW MAN / DONT HAVE... A COW MAN / DONT HAVE... A COW MAN / HAVE A PIECE OF FISH! Oy!
Whats wrong, Bart? You love youth culture!	Mom, a religion isnt cool just because theyve glommed onto some crappy rock band from the nineteen forties.
Back off, you servants of the Holy See!	Easy on the zeal, church-os! Ive got something to say.
Easy on the zeal, church-os! Ive got something to say.	Dont you get it -- its all Christianity, people! The little stupid differences are nothing next to the big stupid similarities!
Why would we want to go to Santas Village? Its August.	I want to see Santa. He can explain why he gave me a PlayStation box with nothing inside but a coloring book.
Thats because they dont thrive in this environment.	Whatcha readin, Santa?
Tom Clancys Op Center.	You dont seem very jolly.
Merry Christmas! Im your old pal Frosty the Snowman.	In your dreams.
Mom, I got a rash where the reindeer licked me.	When they put Santa in the ambulance, why did they pull the blanket all the way up over his head?
Me? But Im the father.	Boy, Homer. Ive never seen Mom this mad.
Kids, Im sure your mother will be back soon.	She should be back now. Its dinner time.
Look, weve been down this road before. I do something stupid, your Mom leaves, we eat waffles.	Were out of waffles.
Gotta find your Mom. Gotta find your Mom.	Dad, I promise Ill be good.
Dad, I promise Ill be good.	Can I get out of the dog carrier?
Okay, kids, well stop for the day. I have cousins near here. Well stay with them.	Country cousins? Are they rubes? Cause I dont cotton to rubes.
Oh, the rubiest. Ooh look! A new restaurant chain!	Can we say its my birthday and get free stuff?
My recording studio!	So, how are we related again?
Our dogs are brothers.	Oh yeah...
Okay. To save the manatees, I guess I could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that.	Dad! Those jet skiers are headed right for a herd of manatees!
Stupid best friend Flanders.	A stamp museum?
Okay, how about this? Seven, four three one... oh wait, thats my pin number. Everyone forget that.	Again! Again!
Again! Again!	Again!
Again!	Again!
Again!	Thats enough.
This stinks -- my room is the only one that faces that cemetery!	Then the zombies will eat you first, and you wont have to watch em eat us.
Thanks for making me feel better.	Well, thanks for making me feel better, knowing that your screams when the zombies chomp your brains will warn me so I can get away.
Theres no such thing as zombies!	Oh, glad to hear you say that -- because the person who doesnt believe in zombies is always the first to get feasted upon.
Bart, dont you have homework to do?	Yeah, and I could really use your help.
No ones gonna pay a buck to drink water from your hose --	Pay the man, Homer.
The Land of the Wild Beasts? Thats the first book I read all the way through.	You read a book all the way through? Why?
Milton Burkharts work has touched on every genre from books to films... to advertising!	All right, commercials!
The brakes are shot.	Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Mom, I think theres a danger this time they might lose the Ponderosa!	Ow.
I cant keep sleeping in Mom and Dads room.	Yeah, if Dad ever rolls over, youre dead.
Wheres Lisa, boy? This books gonna solve all her problems.	Well, if youre lookin for Lisa, she said she was gonna spend the night in the boneyard out back.
The cemetery? And youre just sitting here?	I figured the best thing I could do is monitor the news for any reports.
This is so boring.	Hey Mom, can we have fried chicken for dinner?
Cant even go in my own kitchen... Barts in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.	Mmm. Dont worry, Dad. Im saving one for you.
Mmm. Dont worry, Dad. Im saving one for you.	Ill just leave it here in the dogs mouth.
Now featuring the Pox Box! Pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. Like any disease box, results may vary. Pox box!	What do you think?
Sweet Lizzie McGuire!	You think thats traumatic.
So Milhouse walks into the bedroom, and theres his Mom and Dad going...	Oh, Mr. Van Houten, I love when you kiss me! Yeah, yeah, kissing ladies is the best. Oh baby, kiss my mouth. Kiss me like were in a fancy hotel.
This trial un-separation stinks. My parents used to compete for my love, and I cashed in every time.	And I always got the spillover. Drive-in movies, two Christmases, soda with dinner -- we lived like kings!
Remember when you told my Dad to go to bed and he did?	That was some New Years. Now listen. I think we should consider breaking your parents up again.
I dont know, Bart. Ive wanted them back together for so long.	Look, you know theyre gonna separate again. So why dont we just speed up the process?
You know, Bart, my imaginary friend never made me do things I thought were wrong.	Thats why he had to go away forever.
I thought you were gonna let him come back!	Im afraid he has to spend another year searching for his brain.
Maybe my Mom and Dad are meant to be together, Bart.	Youd better hope not, cause you know what comes next? Your worst nightmare a baby sister.
Hi, Bart. I baked you some cookies.	Skanks for nothing, Lamerella.
I bet that bra was planted by Sterling, to break them up.	Thats a brilliant idea. Those TV writers are geniuses!
Gladly.	We tried to break up your parents and we broke up mine!
Okay look, you and Mom can fix this. What exactly happened between the two of you?	Lisa, we dont need to know how. Its just a natural thing that happens, like a hurricane or going to war.
Bart, I think youre behind this whole thing.	Yeah, I can see how youd think that. But on the other hand...
I can read you like a book.	Ha, ha, you read books.
If you dont tell Mom what you did, I will.	Oh come on, wouldnt it be easier if our parents divorced and you compensated by marrying much older men? Meanwhile, Ill be one of those weird guys whos thirty-five and shows up at high school basketball games.
Why did I marry that selfish jerk? Ive asked him to flip the mattress a thousand times, and he never does!	Uh, Mom?
Hi, sweetie.	Uh... you know that bra that broke up our family?
Uh-hmm.	Well, I looked into it, and it turns out I was responsible.
Really? Well, just for that Im gonna erase all the saved games on your PlayStation.	What?! How do you know about things like that?
I learned about it in here.	But now Dad can come home, right?
No.	But hes innocent.
Innocent?! After all I do for your father, he still doesnt trust me. Im finished with him.	Does this mean you and Dad might get a D-A-V-U-R-S?
Young man, you go work on your spelling... or Ill delete all the custom ring tones from your cell phone!	Nooo!!!!!
ONE MAN LIKES TO PUSH A PLOUGH	THE OTHER LIKES TO CHASE A COW
What do you think, Bart? A hoedown could solve all our problems. I just need your chap size. Its two more than your pant size.	How many times do I have to tell you no Rodgers and Hammerstein!
Rodgers and Hart?	No!
Stupid movie schemes do not work in real life. Mom and Dad have a marriage on the rocks and they need to work through it in therapy to make sure it doesnt shatter.	Rocks... shatter... jagged cliff... Lis, youve just given me an idea for the most insane, hair-brained, fool-proof scheme ever!
I dont want to live in a world without Bart!	Okay. When Mom and Dad see this dummy fall in the river, theyll think its me, and theyll realize what really matters each other.
Do you like the dummy, Bart? I even made it smell like you.	Now, to make sure Homer and Marge are in proper viewing position...
Yeah. What are you going as for Halloween?	Pile of dog doo. Lets roll.
Pile of dog doo. Lets roll.	Mom, Dad! Im playing on a dangerous cliff -- because youre too busy arguing to pay attention to me!
Bart! Were all disappointed theres no potato salad! But for Gods sake, dont jump!	Now!
Okay.	Mom... Dad. Id give a kajillion dollars for you to get back together.
For thirty-five cents off, I love it!	Hey Lis, I bet I could jump in the swimming pool from here.
Bart, that would be the stupidest thing you ever did.	No, the stupidest thing would be doing it backwards.
No, the stupidest thing would be doing it backwards.	Cowa--
And heres how to push his.	Time to destroy the one who did this to me.
David, youre by far the best son Ive ever had. Uh-oh.	Did you replace me with this tinkertoy?
Bart, we can be friends.	Eat my shorts.
Lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. In the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the American dream.	Thank God I landed in a bunch of fruity birds.
Thank God I landed in a bunch of fruity birds.	This is where stem cell research led us!
The sad part is, there were times when I actually had feelings for you. I almost felt I was your father.	What are you talking about?
David feels, and your mother will agree when I tell her, that its best for our family if youre no longer in it.	Were still going to the toy store, right? And I can pick out as many toys as I want?
Dont fear us. Were gentle robots who were cast off just like you.	Im not a robot, Im human.
Tell me, young man. What is it like to have... feelings?	I said Im a human, not a girl.
Uh, I think its about time we all powered down for the night.	Can I stay with you guys tonight?
Of course. And maybe someday, you will teach us... to love.	Yeah, maybe. What did you used to do?
I was a lawnmower. I could cut grass at three different heights... but I could not love.	I get it, I get it! Sucks to be you. Goodnight.
Honey, animals dont feel death. That was proved by the scientists at Black Angus.	No fair! Dad gets to kill wild animals, but I shoot one bird and I have to go to a psychiatrist.
Im not a raccoon, Im the Lone Ranger! Im too poor to afford the hat.	Thats not even a mask. Its axle grease!
Theyre tearing down the pier!	But what will junkies do drugs under?
Hey, hey, hey! Oh, hes got us in a corner. I hate this ride!	Mom, can we buy a magnesium-vapor soak tub?
For the last time, no!	But how will I increase my vitality?
Bart, howd you like to go on a tandem bike ride with your mom?	Mom, please. Im playing a video game.
Mom, please. Im playing a video game.	Ooh -- small hill. Pedal, pedal, pedal!
Ooh -- small hill. Pedal, pedal, pedal!	Now, enjoy scenery. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!
Haw haw! Shes lonely.	Moms dont get lonely.
Woo hoo! Pizza for breakfast!	Mom, I mean it. I wanna ride with you.
Homer, focus!	I HEARD OL NEIL PUT HER DOWN.
WELL, I HOPE NEIL YOUNG WILL REMEMBER...	THIS SOUTHERN MAN DONT NEED HIM ROUND, ANYHOW! Mom, whos Neil Young?
Wanna go inside?	Iunno. Think they have videogames?
No.	Batting cage?
No.	Rock climbing wall?
No.	Robot musical revue?
No.	Zumanity by Cirque de Soleil?
No.	Bathroom?
Yes.	Well, thats really what I need the most. Lets go.
You havent had any tea.	Yeah, well I still love this place.
Good afternoon, madam. Whos your handsome gentleman friend?	Oh, you.
Well, we could bike to the tea shop and have some cake.	All right! Pedal to the kettle!
Hey, Bart! Theyre testing me for lazy eye! Wanna come with?	Sorry, Milhouse, Ive got plans.
You know, honey, Ive really started to look forward to our little bike rides.	Me too, Mother.
Loyal customers, we have been forced to close forever. It seems our cakes were filled with rat droppings. Its not that were bad people, we just werent paying close attention. Ta-taa!	Whatd it say?
Well, Bart, I guess thats it. Well have to go back to our separate things.	Hey, we could have tea in my treehouse.
So... is that standing water?	Yeah. You know, that puddle started life as a bowl of cereal.
I think I might be able to turn this treehouse into a teahouse.	Mom, this is great! It makes our real house look like a pile of crap.
And I threw out all your old comics!	Mom!
Ill answer for you yes.	What? Um... uh... I just shoplifted this bad boy. Housewares never knew what hit em.
Why didnt you steal something cool?	Uh... because Im gonna bring it back to the store for store credit.
How you gonna get credit without a gift receipt, ass?	Um, well...
Word on the street is... youre a mamas boy.	Hey, there is no way that Bart Simpson is a mamas boy.
Bart, are you having a fight with your boyfriends?	Shut up! I dont want your stupid sweatshirt! Or your tea set!
Smashing voids my warranty! Have a good life!	Mom, I only hung out with you because I felt sorry for you!
SIDE-BY-SIDE ON MY PIANO KEYBOARD / OH LORD, WHY DONT WE...	I cant believe she suckered me into being a mamas boy. Ive got to make this place mine again.
I cant believe she suckered me into being a mamas boy. Ive got to make this place mine again.	Its gonna take me weeks to get the booger wall back up.
Bart?	Youre not allowed in here! Cant you read the sign?
You mean this?	Ay carumba!
Mom, I really did like hanging out with you.	You know... theres a karaoke night at school tomorrow. Some of the little kids are bringing their parents. Do you wanna go?
Really? Could we do a duet?	Sure... why not? Itll be fun.
WHERE IS MY JOHN WAYNE / WHERE IS MY PRAIRIE SUN / WHERE IS MY HAPPY ENDING / WHERE HAVE ALL THE COWBOYS GONE? / DO DO / DO DO DO / DO DO DO / DO DO DO DO, DO	You know, Mother, I wasnt sure about tonight. But seeing us dressed the same really feels right!
Well, now Im not so sure about the bells on the painters pants.	Are you kidding? I love my tinklies.
Hush up, Seymour. Shes just saying what were all thinking.	Mother, what are you doing?
What, a wall?	Mom, I thought this is what you wanted.
Your job isnt to worry about me, its to give me things to worry about.	Hey losers, Im gonna do to you what you did to these songs.
Interpret them artistically?	Die! Die! Die!
Oh, can I come with you? I know I cant.	Hey Mom, can I have some money to buy Dad a present?
If I give you money, how is the gift really from you?	Where do you get your money?
Come on, Ralphie! Big money, big money, Ralphie! Big money.	Cool...
Cool...	Thats what Im gettin, how bout you?
Im afraid the best thing I could find is this.	Ay carumba.
What a great Fathers Day!	Here you go, Dad. I hope you like it. Ive forgotten what it is.
Its like the Sixth Amendment or something.	Well, that sign would look good hidden under my bed.
Uh, well, my son is here too. Lets meet him now.	Heeeres Bart!
Son, I need to find a new friend for your mother. So youre gonna have to finish the shopping yourself.	Were on food stamps?
What?! I am so out of here.	Wow Mom, great red dress!
What is this crap?	This is worse than Wheelchair-nocchio.
Well, some people in Europe have the impression that America has made some stupid choices in the past, oh, five years. So for the next week, Im from Canada.	I think Dad may blow your cover.
Marge... are you encouraging me to be irresponsible?	Why dont you encourage him to get us some health insurance?
I get it -- the midget represents dwarves.	Dad, cheese truck!
Yeah, I tell Marge everything! Not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such.	Bob, your family will find out the truth. Sooner or later youll try to kill me again. Watch, Ill prove it.
Bob, your family will find out the truth. Sooner or later youll try to kill me again. Watch, Ill prove it.	Cmon, slice, dice, and serve on rice.
Marge, dont be so Olive Garden.	Yeah, this is Italy -- look, the town drunk is two years old.
Boy, that Sideshow Bob goes from zero to murder awfully fast.	At least this time it was Lisa who ruined Bobs life.
Lets see, I aint doin that, thats not funny, here well change wealthy merchant to nudist with big rack, this needs punching up, thats comin out, two acts?	Krusty, you gotta help us.
Thats my opening joke. And my closer! And my saver! And my topper!	Please help us, Krusty. We dont want to be the first Christians to die at the Colosseum.
Quick! Get in!	Krusty! You saved us!
Its Santa!	Grampa?!
Trying to kill Santa. Whats it to ya?	What do you have against Santa?
Oh, Bart, whyd you ask him a follow-up question?	It just slipped out!
IVE STILL GOTTA BAKE MY CHRISTMAS PIE!	IVE GOTTA GET DAD A LOUSY TIE!
HES AT THE DOOR!	LETS HIT THE FLOOR!
I got a forty-year-old letter for Mrs. Abraham Simpson.	My Gramma? I havent seen her in years. She ran away.
Ran away from all this? What a fool.	Hey Grampa, we got a letter for Gramma.
See.	Yeah, but that also works for the dogs butt.
See, Abe, were still visiting you, even though we have no biological obligation.	Youve said that three times already!
Well, well, Bart Simpson in trouble again. School hasnt even started yet.	What can I say? I missed you, Myra.
What can I say? I missed you, Myra.	Hows things with you and Frank?
That bum! He says his divorce will be final next week. So why is she pregnant again?	Ouch. You hang in there, beautiful.
Ouch. You hang in there, beautiful.	So, wheres the Skin-man?
Ay carumba.	Thank you, Satan!
Just think, Milhouse. From now on well always be those kids who got into the Steam Tunnels.	Now I gotta warn you. We could get in trouble.
These steam tunnels are awesome. Its like were in the schools lymphatic system -- and were the lymph.	Oh, my God! My Dad had a long talk with me about this, but you cant believe it till you see it!
The cafeteria loading dock!	Look -- were havin pizza tomorrow!
Well, we made it to the valve room. Now we can leave without touching a valve. What a tale thatll be.	Hey, we cant leave here without turning one little valve.
Dont bother struggling -- Ive got your scruff.	Can I cut a deal? Ill give you Milhouse.
Hey guys, I have to put the boy on a plane to soul-crushing camp, then Ill be back to go to Vegas!	Dad, if you take me to Vegas, Ill teach you how to cheat at blackjack.
Boy, you dont need to cheat when you got a system.	Whats your system?
Please keep your seatbelt fastened until we have come to a complete stop.	Nobody tells Bart Simpson what to do.
Oh yeah?! Youre going to that camp, cause Im gonna drive you there.	Yeah, thatll be way more fun than Vegas.
Stupid Bart... makes me drive to Oregon... home of unspoiled forests... birthplace of Matt Groening ...	Dad, neither of us wanna go. Why are you doing this? Wheres the old carefree Homer who likes to cut loose?
You mean Fun Homer? Im afraid Serious Homer has him locked up till youre at your snooty torture camp.	Fight back, fun Homer! Together we can win!
Eh.	Cmon, Dad, we got a long way to go. You cant stay mad at me the whole time.
Boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, youd clean up your act.	Well maybe pulling pranks is the only thing Im good at.
Look at me, I use a napkin.	Well Dad, we may not always get along, but well never be that lame.
I bet theyre from Massachusetts. You know, its legal there for a guy to marry his son.	Well, I guess its tinkle time.
Boy! Push down on the bumper! Then I can back the car up and save myself.	Hm, if I save you, what are you gonna do to me?
Well boy, you made the right choice. I think this is the first step to a new, closer relationship between us.	Dad, I think you actually enjoy seeing your own son suffer.
I dont enjoy it. Being a father is just a job. Long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling you screwed me up!	Well, maybe if you enjoyed me more, I wouldnt be so screwed up.
Nicely chopped, Simpson.	Ive learned so much in my three hours here. I dont have to play pranks to feel good. I can just listen to the gentle rhythms of nature.
Wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!	Dad?
Son, Im doing something I should have done a long time ago... taking you to Vegas!	Im gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet!
Bombardment! Deal with it! Bombardment! Lifes a bitch, son! Bombardment! Bombardment! Walk it off! Bombardment! Bombardment!	I caught it! Im safe!
Son, are you okay?	I guess.
Sweetie, if someones bullying you, you should tell your teacher.	But its the teacher whos bullying me.
Kiss rubber, loser! You cry like a little girl, Amy! Oh come on now - those were just baby teeth!	Oh, how much longer can this go on?
Bombardment. Bombardment. How do you like bombardment? Ill show him.	Time for the bombarded to become the bombardier.
Time for the bombarded to become the bombardier.	Whyd I put this in here?
Simpson! Simpson!	Hee-eere.
What is your major malfunction, Simpson?! You will defrost, drain, and surrender that ball. And then I will use it to bombard you! Bombardment!	Kid power!
Dont be tantalizin me with tales of ravines and rusted-out cars. Ill only be gettin me heart broke.	Thats my mom, I gotta go. I finished nailing this board.
Thats my mom, I gotta go. I finished nailing this board.	Oh yeah, youre out of nails.
Thats it.	Maybe you could aim a little higher.
Youre right, Lisa! I do want to better me lot. To live like a normal...	Hey, thats great. Gnight.
I bet I could turn him into a proper gentleman! And I will do it in time for the School Science Fair!	Youre on, Lis.
What flows from me nose... Uh... Its no use. Im not very cultured. I dont even have a last name!	Care to concede that bet?
Willie, there are no more lessons. Youre a proper gentleman, my work is done.	And that jobs taken. Skinner dumped it on the next-lowest guy on the totem pole.
Dont worry, Bart. I brought something thatll keep you interested -- a nickel in a water bottle!	Wow! Wow!!! WOW!!!
Hell sleep tonight.	Whered it go?! Whered it go?! Oh, its in the cap.
Dont worry, Homer. Well get that fireman who cut you out of that teacup ride.	That was two firemen, a crane and Snow White.
We couldnt find a way out.	But on the upside, I found some cave paintings and made them awesome.
Young man, its summertime. What are you doing here?	Ive got detention all summer.
Why?	Because Im a screw-up. My sisters the smart one -- all I do is get in trouble.
Aw sweetheart, do you want to do better?	Oh, it doesnt matter. Everyones pretty much given up on me. I bet I wont even make it through fourth grade.
You never had detention all summer.	Oh, that load of crap? No, I was just keepin her busy while Nelson stole microscopes. Make with the story.
Ready!	And... joust!
That was awesome!	Lets do it again!
Im not a real bear! That was just the name of my character. Now let me out!	Hey, you know where the bathroom is?
Oh, she probably misses her children. Theyre all in show business. One of them played the out-of-control judiciary in a Republican party commercial.	Cheer up, Toot-Toot. Have some of my ice cream.
No, no, its still kid-napped. The prefix applies to the victim.	Help! Shes grooming me! Shes grooming me!
Look, its been fun and all, but I miss indoor plumbing.	Sorry, lady. Ive never eaten fresh fruit and I reckon I never will.
Lisa, monkeys dont have feelings. If they did, then my experiments could be called cruel.	Toot-Toot! Look! Im using this rock as a tool!
Toot-Toot! Look! Im using this rock as a tool!	Ow!
Hurry, lets climb down.	Okay, but dont let our hands touch. Its gay.
Whats gay mean?	Um... it means you used to be afraid, but now youre not.
Dad? Please come home, we miss you. Is that a high-def TV?!	Mom didnt say anything about high-def!
Oh really? Bart, when did you get your tenure?	I got my tenure right here.
Bart, I told you no television till you do the dishes. And I do not call that doing the dishes.	Well, my Mom says why bother punishing me, I never learn.
Disgusting. Young man, Im going to turn that cartoon into homework.	Help me, cameraman! I let you smoke a cigarette in my bedroom.
No. My soon to be ex-wife.	I, uh, I dont think you wanna see her just now.
Homie, snagging a pro football franchise is a big project, requiring a lot of follow-through...	And thats not your strong suit, big guy.
Is the practice bull ready?	Hell, yeah!
Hey, Marge its what Ive gotta do to keep this family living in luxury.	Luxury? This thermostat is just painted on.
Just outsource it to Lisa. Outsourcing is the answer to everything.	Also, I cant sleep at night cause theres this new bully who follows me home and...
Also, I cant sleep at night cause theres this new bully who follows me home and...	I think hes in the house!
May firrr... seconnn... thirrr...	You dont have to worship him. Hes not a God.
Do you have your shipboard entertainments?	Ive got my toy wood lump!
Ive got my toy wood lump!	What jolly fun!
I guess well never make it to the new world.	When we landed, I was gonna denounce my sister as a witch.
I keep telling you, the ability to add two-digit numbers is not witchcraft!	Thirty-one plus forty-three.
Homer, you can tell the third story. Bart will tell the second, which is usually the weakest.	Hey!
Im just trying to take the pressure off of you.	Well, one time I read this boring comic book about a ship called The Bounty...
And were gonna remove all evidence of the previous regime, starting with this stupid wheel.	Uh-oh.
Im starting to think the Sea Captain isnt coming back.	Hes out there playin basketball!
Were Jewish all right!	Whats our back story? Whats our back story?
Mama Mia, what a time to be carrying the soup.	Cool! No gravity!
Cool! No gravity!	Oh, there it is.
Stand aside. I shall perform the necessary heroics. Thank you!	You?
Looking through my purse, looking through my purse... keep walking, monkey!	Dont worry, Mom. They all passed by.
I love the use of streamers as blood. It robs the violence of its power.	Woo hoo! Im drenched in blood!
Yeah, one for boys and one for girls.	It is gonna be awesome! Now I can walk down the hall with Bart Junior hangin out. Isnt that right, Bart Junior?
Whatre you playing?	Punch for a punch.
Punch for a punch.	So whats your name, newbie?
Uh... Boy... man... Boyman. Jake Boyman.	You have toilet paper on your shoe.
Yeah, I guess I do.	Im gonna call you Toilet.
Now, how many different numbers can Y be?	Toilet.
Hey Lis, you missed it. While you were at girls school, Nelson totally whaled on this dork.	Oh my God...
Oh my God...	So, did you tell Mom you got beat up?
Not yet. If I do, shell never let me go to the boys math class again.	Hey, no one with a choice should ever have to be a girl. Ill teach you how to be a boy.
Youd do that for me? That is so sweet.	Youre a boy -- nothing is sweet.
Ow, that hurt.	Sweet.
Now, when you eat like a boy, only two French fries in five should make it into your mouth.	If they fall on the floor, you want em more. Because then they come with extra toppings.
Im gonna be sick.	Awesome! Do it in that guys bag while hes not looking.
Uh... uh...	I guess Im gonna have to get this party started.
I guess Im gonna have to get this party started.	Fight! Fight! Fight!
Thats right, everyone. The best math student in the whole school is a girl!	Wait a minute -- do you know why you did good at math?
Oh, Superintendent.	The only reason Lisa won is because she learned to think like a boy! I turned her into a burping, farting, bullying, math machine!
Are you sure we can make money doing this? What if nobody wants their address painted on the curb?	Duh! Nobody wants their address painted on the curb. We do it without asking, and then they have to pay.
Wait a minute -- thats not a scam.	Thats honest work for honest pay!
Screw you! Im never gonna pay!	Well, then were gonna leave you one digit short.
Son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things bills, jury duty, Entertainment Weekly. Now, for once, Im getting rich-person mail. You wouldnt take that away from me, would you, son?	Oh Dad, no one can rationalize like you.
Well, talk to me in a week.	Hi, Im Bart. Im ten years old and a professional moto-cross jumper. Can you buy me a moto-cross bike?
Ooh, I cant wait to see what kind of home we live in.	Oh its great. Like somebody barfed a two-story pile of puke.
Yeah, but hes cool with it. Right?	It hurts when I swallow.
I remember Bart!	I cant believe you remembered me through Milhouse. Hes not even my best friend.
This is horrible.	Weve got to tell Dad!
Dad, we dont want you to leave!	My grades will suffer! In fact, theyre already suffering.
My grades will suffer! In fact, theyre already suffering.	Look at this garden of Fs. You planted them all!
Commercials. I am your host, Booberella. I hope you enjoy our Labor Day Marathon of Murder. Because soon you have to go back to school. Schooool!	School? Oh my God, Ive wasted the whole summer. Theres so many things I still wanna do.
Ive got to squeeze a whole summer of carefree fun into one day.	Win Baseball Game.
Son, you have time for the pizza party?	Sure, why not?
Sure, why not?	Appear in Summer Stock Play...
...THATS GREEEEEASE!	Sit on it, Springfield! Yeah!
Sit on it, Springfield! Yeah!	Summer blockbuster...
Get outta my face you raggedy maggots.	Oh... so thats why everyones been sayin that all summer.
No, not yet! I have to have a summer romance!	Ill never forget you.
Ill never forget you.	Gotta go.
Well, Im so glad theres a show we women can enjoy!	Weaving?!
Weaving?!	Homer, youre my father, youre supposed to protect me from things like this!
Bart, its still history.	Not if I spend the whole time running around like this.
Not if I spend the whole time running around like this.	Die, weapons, die!
Stop.	Cmon, Milhouse. Do you wanna play in the NBA or not?
Bart, my arms out of its thing.	That means its working.
Well then I choose... uh...	So, according to creationism, there were no cavemen.
Lisa, I think I have a way to help you at the trial today.	So do I!
So do I!	Milhouse will serve the time for you while you flee to Mexico. Your new name SeÃ±orita Ugly.
Honey, I appreciate the thought, but just leave everything to me.	You can take off the wig, Milhouse.
Its amazing theyve gotten five hundred and twelve shows out of this premise.	Remember when we saw Hunchs butt in the shower?
You wanna know somethin, Bart?	Nah, I know enough.
Thats an E-3 if youre keeping score at home, and if you are, your loneliness saddens me.	Sokay, Buck! Bad hop, bad hop!
Shake it off, Buck!	You suck!
We both find public displays of affection vulgar.	Cmon, Doc -- shes a fine-lookin woman! You dont wanna work that?
SEXY MARRIAGE LAND!	Wow. Ive got this sudden urge to give her a five dollar bill.
Yeah, they beat me up at work. Look at the word they wrote on my skull.	Oh, Papa.
Well, yeah. He was the first man who didnt just like me for my body. He always complimented me on my hair. Ooh, your standing lamp is dirty. Ill polish it.	Cancel all my appointments.
Nature?! The ultimate bring-down! Why...was I...born?!	Dont worry, dude. Well hook you up with some tunes.
Hop in what?	Look at me, Im Otto! Im a hundred years old and I drive a school bus!
Bye-bye, take care, watch your step, eat my shorts, have a good one...	Shes all yours, dude. Oh, and I think I ran over a moose.
I hope youre happy, Bart. Thanks to your hi-jinx, I have to drive you and your friends to school.	Let me drive. I go through yellow lights.
One more crack out of you, young man, and Im showing everyone your baby pictures.	Sorry, sorry, sorry!
Yes, Papa.	That was Fat Tony!
You could make a great chef someday.	Cool! Who is it?
Ive tried to make those, but they always end up as brownies.	You said you meant to make brownies. Any other lies?
Hey hey, its Fat Tonys crew! Hows the big guy doing? I sent flowers but you probably didnt get them... you know florists, Glug, glug!	Krusty, Fat Tony hasnt received his weekly payment for keeping McDonalds and Burger King out of town.
Where did you get that?	It fell off a truck-truck truck.
Hi-diddily-ho, mob-areenos!	I dont know.
I... uh... I got your phone bill in my mail by mistake... and, uh... Ill just pay it.	Dad, you want I should plug him in the ankle?
But you... you got a future in this business. Call me.	Thanks, but Im going into bootleg DVDs.
Ill tell you how she died. You know that sign that says Do not stand up on the roller coaster?	Yeah.
Amber said she wouldnt let her eighth-grade education stop her from achieving her dreams. And yet, it did.	Yes. Of course.
Bart, put that away!	Uh-oh.
Hey kid, why dont you watch where youre drumming!	Sorry, White Stripes. No hard feelings?
Boy, get dressed. Youre going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket youre making!	I thought you wanted me to drum!
What it is, hep cats? you want me to scat-sing the menu?	Absolutely not.
Hey Bart, you wanna jam with me?	Okay... if you give me your omelet.
Okay... if you give me your omelet.	Woo hoo! Im a professional musician!
We have deal!	I was jamming with Skinny Turner and Marbles Le Marquez! And they want me to join their trio!
Mild-mild-mild-mild-mild!	Lisa, youve got to be more careful! I need you to teach me all about the world of juzz.
Downbeat, downbeat, please. Were shootin the breeze with Tic Tock.	Man, I am so juzzed.
Oh, son. I like you more, now that other people like you.	Its mergatronic, Daddy-Ho.
Bart, does that even mean anything?	Xavier Cugat!
Bart! What are you doing here?	Not smoking reefer!
No, Buttercup! No!	My arm! It hurts where the tigers biting it!
Bart, that was a nasty bite you got. Youll recover... but youll never drum again.	Says you!
Says you!	I was a great drummer, and now Im nothing! Just like Phil Collins.
Sorry, Tic Tock. Your tick is on... but your tock is gone!	Well, Ive got a confession to make. This right arm... its not mine.
Yeah, thats the jingle.	The doctor did say surgery might help... but it costs seventy-eight thousand dollars!
Somethin like what together?	The benefit concert!
Im very happy for you, Bart.	Why are you sad? Thinking about your marriage?
If we cant find a home for those animals, theyll be put to sleep. Your sisters very upset.	I feel weird. Its like a potato chip full of shame, going down my throat sideways.
Honey, what youre feeling is called empathy.	Now Im gonna learn a new word.
Empathy means youre looking at Lisa, and feeling what she feels. Your sister poured her heart into rescuing those animals to forget the pain of being upstaged in jazz. And now...	How can I end this torture?!
You could do something nice for Lisa.	Youre my mother! How can you say that?
You aint so bad.	Good morn-ing.
Gooey Martin, Willie Mimms, Drop Jaws Turner, Sketch Friendly, Tootsie Childs, Sammy Biltmore, No-Talent Jones, Anwar Benitez, Bossy Marmalade, Bad-Check Mazursky, Ray-Ray Takamura, Shaky Premise, Bootsy Croutonne, Richard Sakai, The Pre-Marital Sextet, C.S.I. Miami, D.W. Jitters! The Chubb Group, Cantaloupe St. Pierre, and many, many, more funny names! And its all to fix this very talented arm!	Ow!
Oh, right, the nerve damage. Heres the benefit money -- now Im gonna go vomit to keep my weight down. Thats right, thats how Krusty does it.	I wanna thank everyone for this special night. Jazz folk may have the smallest apartments, but they also have the biggest hearts.
I wanna thank everyone for this special night. Jazz folk may have the smallest apartments, but they also have the biggest hearts.	But the biggest heart I know is in my sister Lisa.
...Tootsie Childs?	Lis, you poured your heart into rescuing societys most vulnerable critters animals. So I want all the money weve raised tonight to go to building... The Lisa Simpson Home for Abandoned Animals!
This place is looking a little run down.	Yeah, hasnt been the same since they murdered the Mayors Dad here.
Deal!	These games are so old. Who got these high scores? Pilgrims? Hmm, never saw this one before.
These games are so old. Who got these high scores? Pilgrims? Hmm, never saw this one before.	Whats going on here? Am I destroying these triangles or trying to assemble them? What does this button do? Now my ship is pooping more triangles!
Whats going on here? Am I destroying these triangles or trying to assemble them? What does this button do? Now my ship is pooping more triangles!	Oh no, I won a free game!
I never wanna go back to that mall. There were eels in the photo booth!	Ew.
Bart, heres a letter from your school!	A fire?! I didnt start a fire in the teachers lounge! I mean, what fire? I mean, a letter from school? Please elaborate.
Wow Mom, you made all this?	Its like youre the Jesus of carpentry.
Mmm... extra-virgin...	Why should we have to give up our salty snacks, just to keep one allergic kid from exploding?! Who is this selfish jerk anyway?
Ill never say his name!	His, eh? Hmm, so its a dude.
Who says its a dude? A principal can be a man or a woman these days.	Hmmm.
Bart, Skinners gonna be really mad at you.	Yes, you might say hell blow up.
Simpson! Report to detention at once.	Im not a big fan of detention. You might say, it drives me nuts.
I brought you breakfast in bed.	Eat it.
Simpson, youve been waving your nuts in my face for too long. Eat shrimp and die!	No! Im allergic!
Stick-on-stick. Just like the knights of old.	No one teaches me history!
Peanut?!	Shrimp?!
If either of us falls in, were doomed!	Kids dont die!
What kind of lies are you feeding her, Simpson?	Mind your own beeswax!
Still hungry.	Dad?
Ill savor you!	Grampa?
What happened to for better or for worse?!	Dad, youre eating Dr. Phil!
Arent you coming, Bart?	No, Im gonna go backstage and complain. This Krusty Brand alarm clock sprays acid in your face.
You already showed me before!	Whoa, Krustys prop room!
Whoa, Krustys prop room!	Cool! Its that clown car all those midgets drowned in!
For kids, forty-nine bucks!	Krusty, whats that monster?
You made my lady cry!	Come to my house at midnight.
Hey, Milhouse.	It worked!
It worked!	Now, theres something Ive wanted to do for a long time.
Now, theres something Ive wanted to do for a long time.	Cant you read my writing? I didnt say kick Homers walls.
Whats goin on?	Thats better.
Yo, Simpson. Give us your lunch money.	I dont think so. In fact, why dont you give me your lunch money?
Whos gonna make us? That golem?	No, my go-- Yes, him.
No, my go-- Yes, him.	Finally, someone who does whatever I say.
Hey Bart, I shaved my head, like you told me.	Get lost.
Bart, did your mystical Jewish monster beat up those bullies?	Oh, its always the Jews fault.
Hey boy, wheres your mud buddy? I have a little job for him.	He was driving me crazy so I sent him on an errand.
You got a surprise for me? The surprise would be if I found some good live theater in this town. Then people could have some drinks, watch Fiddler... very nice.	Will you shut up?
Lisa, that was just a radio show.	Uh, Paw.
Bart, can we go to Banana Republic? Theres a mannequin there I have a crush on.	Milhouse, that is the most pathetic thing I ever... oh my God, shes beautiful!
Oh shoe-boy? Im looking for something in a cross-trainer.	What size do I smell like?
Youre lacing it wrong! I want it overy-undery, not undery-overy.	Re-lace them all!
Well, what if there was a violent video game that you could play for free, plus its real life and not a game at all? Wouldnt that be slammin?	Who are these wonderful people?
How about you bite me?	Great news, Ma! I agreed to join the army when I turn eighteen!
Now listen, Bub. You go down to those recruiters and tell them Bart is too young for the Army. I dont want this to be the only memory I have of him.	How come I cant join the army but Lisa gets to be in PETA?
Homer, with all the things youve done -- go into space, attend clown college, join the Navy -- I never thought youd join the Army!	Whoa, even the Army has Humvees now!
Dont worry. I have a secret weapon -- one more powerful than any gun.	Lisas face?
Seventy-two lousy events, and Grampa hasnt won a single medal.	Well, its not fair when Moleman uses his replacement legs.
No one makes my daughter sob and run.	He ruined her first Wordloaf!
Touched in the head, is he?	A-yup.
Bart, what are you doing?	I only eat the clown heads.
Thats so wasteful.	Ive always done it. Just like I only eat the eyes off a lobster.
Marge?	Shes been gone for a while.
A complete list of things I have seen or not seen is available on my blog. Your mother is on the not seen list, along with a Star Wars film that was any good since the first one. And even that has been ruined by CGI additions! Bravo, George.	Theres Mom!
Mom! Barts drinking coffee!	Its not coffee, its hot Pepsi!
I wish Id married Lenny and his friend!	Man, Mom and Dad are really going at it.
Unthinkable! / Is that legal?	Wait. What if... NOBODY goes? He cant kill all of us.
You actually convinced people not to go to Nelsons party?	Yup, hell be all alone on his birthday! Oh, I wish I could see it. Boo hoo! Im Nelson. No one likes me.
Bartholomew J. Simpson, how can you be so mean?	What are you gonna do about it?
What are you gonna do about it?	Hey!
Ill whack you with the whole salad set if you dont start thinking about others! You are going to that party.	Mom, I cant go -- no one else is!
Well, if no one else jumped off the Empire State Building, would you not jump?	Kind of?
Oh, your elbows like an angels kiss. But you still have to go.	Why?
Son, we all have to do things we dont want to. Like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be Mr. Funny all the time -- You think I wouldnt rather be living nude in the forest? Like some ancient pagan! Just dancing around playing the pan flute! And here we are!	Okay, just walk in, say happy birthday, and get out.
Uh-oh, do I hear a dial tone? Cause this party is off the hook! What up, B?	Um, happy birthday, Nelson.
Uh... I know it seems a little quiet... must be a lot a traffic today. Is highway eighty-eight backed up?	Oh yeah. Its a parking lot out there.
Dont go! My party peeps are en route! I swear!	Nelson... nobodys coming.
But... how could nobody come? I ordered them to.	Well, thats the thing. Sometimes, you can be kind of a jerk.
True... but I thought I had some friends.	Maybe you can have fun with just me.
So, how was Nelsons party?	Not bad. We had pizza, cake, and then sang songs with Nelsons Gramma. But, it was a one-time thing, and now Ill never see him again.
Hey... its my birthday bud!	Yeah, yeah, it was uh, super fun. Good times. Hey, Ralph! Have I got a half a sandwich for you.
Hey, best friend, I got you a present. An entire case of pool cue chalk! Huh? Huh? We can make the tip of anything blue!	Um, Nelson, I was just thinking about us being best friends.
Whoa! Me too! We are so connected!	Look, um, I dont have time for new friends. I got a lot on my plate. Ive got a big report due on the Nile river topic sentence, bibliography, page numbers... its nuts.
Isnt he? Ive known him for years, but I ran into him at a party and we really clicked.	Thats right, were best friends now. So why dont you go pick on someone smaller and weaker?
Hey, gas ball -- you suck!	Nelson, do you ever wish you werent a bully?
Hmm, sometimes. But its not up to me -- its who I am. I mean, a shark cant stop swimming or itll blow up.	Man... I never knew you were so deep.
Here, this is for you.	A Nelson vest!
The sleeves were torn off by wild dogs.	From then on, my life changed.
Hey, Bart.	Milhouse.
Bart, why are you hanging around with Nelson so much? Hes a bully.	Hey, dont use the b word around me. Its offensive.
How come they can say it?	They just can, okay.
Its weird to see you as somebodys sidekick.	Whoa, Bart Simpson is nobodys sidekick.
Then why are you wearing that vest?	Cause my chest is cold and my arms arent.
Come on, Bart. Throw the dork a bone.	All right, I will.
Youre late. I was waitin to smash this frog with you and it peed in my hand.	Sorry, I was uh... stealing loose grapes at the grocery store.
Really? You call this stealing loose grapes?	We were just having fun. Dont get upset.
Hey Bart, do you want some ice cream? I just hit a major marshmallow vein - Ooo, I think it goes all the way to the bottom!	No thanks.
Whats wrong?	Me and Nelson were best friends, and now I think hes gonna kill me!
I feel so bad about freaking out on you. Itll never happen again, I swear.	Um, okay.
Best friends... forever?	No! I cant do it! Youre a nut bar! A whack-job! A kooka-dooka!
No! I cant do it! Youre a nut bar! A whack-job! A kooka-dooka!	Please, just leave me alone!
Looks like youve made your choice. Make sure your affairs are in order.	Ive set up a trust. It bypasses the inheritance tax.
You are a bad friend.	Say again?
You never liked me for me. You liked that I protected you and gave you a vest and stole milk boxes for you. I hate milk! It comes from cow wangs!	There you go again -- you act all nice and then you go crazy.
Well, maybe I get jealous. But its just because... I never had a best friend before.	Um, Nelson? Was the water always up to our necks? Nelson?!
Um, Nelson? Was the water always up to our necks? Nelson?!	Help! Help!
Put this on!	Whered you get it?
Shut up! Im just giving him CPR -- the kiss of life! And if anyone loves Bart its Nelson.	Where is Nelson?
Im sorry. Nelson never woke up.	What?
Never woke up because he never passed out. Hes right over there.	Hey, thanks for saving me, man.
Of course I saved you -- youre my field trip buddy. And nothing else.	You mean...
Why dont you have dinner with us tonight?	Please, Santa?
Its Christmas! Its Christmas! Its Christmas!	I didnt think it would ever come, but it did!
Oh, man. Now hes even mooching our lunches.	All he left me with are these used nicotine patches.
Gil?!!	Gils gone.
Back to Scottsdale.	Problem solved.
End of story.	Can we have pancakes for dinner?
Gunderson!	Whoa, Gils a big shot!
Dad, there arent any places left to sit.	Theres a spot!
Ugh. This is the most disgusting place weve ever gone.	What about Brazil?
Yum-yum fish are all we used to eat here. Theyre the most delicious fish in the ocean.	Better than cod?
Much better.	Oh, baby!
Bart!? What the hell are you doing in there?!	Dad... I couldnt stay with Mom and Lisa while you were out here.
Aw, son.	They were gonna go to the Folk Art Museum, then they were gonna paint crab shells. Not crush them, paint them.
Shiiiii... pwreck!	Were still gonna make it, arent we Dad?
Do you think your Mother will ever remarry?	In about two seconds.
I say Cool Waves.	Neon Breeze!
Girls like you better! Your parents are married!	Ay carumba!
Milhouse, dont you see... youre addicted to revenge.	Im really sorry.
This is it. Its taken all day, weve missed our flight to Hawaii, but finally, Ill get my revenge.	Dad, wait! You havent heard my story.
No, seriously, youre great -- lets hear it.	My story takes place in a time I call the past.
Now lets get you in shape in an old-timey way.	Holy Hannah! Ive got more muscles than a New England clambake. Now all I need is a superhero name.
You can be the Crimson Cockaboy. Hmmm?	Ill keep thinking.
A k-k-k-kid!	Im Bart-Man.
Apu?	Clean, dirty clean, dirty clean, dirty ...
Bart, stop that. Native Americans are a proud people with a noble heritage... A noble heritage that anyone can claim!	Cool -- look what Snaps doing to Pop, while Crackle watches!
Thats where our mom works!	My last words are Lisa suuuucks!
Young man, to show our gratitude... the city of Springfield will grant you one wish.	Really? Hmmm.
Really? Hmmm.	Thats it! I want a license!
To kill?	No, to drive.
Do you wish to be an organ donor?	No way -- I dont want my guts touching some sick guy!
Then throw them over the wall of the prison to create chaos and confusion.	Hello?
Slow down! Youre too close to that car! Your hands should be at ten and two, not three and nothing!	Yknow, itd be a real shame if someone started investigating your Indian heritage.
Ill be good.	Oh, man! What now?
This sucks! I cant do anything fun, cause Im doing so many stupid errands!	Shut up, shut up, shut up!
I gotta get outta this town for a while. Time to put the pedal to the metal.	Hm, North Haverbrook. The very name conjures up romance and intrigue.
Release the hounds!	Man, this towns got everything!
You look kinda young.	Uh... yeah, I have that disease that makes you look like an old man, but they gave me medicine for it and I took too much.
Thats cool. Im Darcy.	Im Bart Simpson, who the hell are you? Oh, right. Darcy.
I really like you, Bart.	That is such a girl thing to say.
Bart... lets get married.	What?!
Why not? Weve made out. Its not right to make out with somebody if you have no intention of marrying them. I mean, youre not a jerk, right?	No, Im not, but--
Bart... Ive been keeping a secret from you too. Im pregnant.	Im gonna be a father?!
What?! No! You couldnt be the father! We never got close to that.	Really? We didnt? But we kissed and held hands at the same time.
Wow, you really are ten. I thought you were just kinda stupid.	Im ten and stupid! Look, if Im not the father, then who is?
A Norwegian exchange student. Hes long gone, back to Norwegia. I wanted you to marry me so my baby would have a dad. Im very religious that way.	How religious can you be if youre pregnant?
How religious can you be if youre pregnant?	Good answer.
Marrying you was my only hope. When my parents find out, theyre gonna kill me.	Look, Darcy, maybe theres still a way we can get married.
Maybe I shouldnt be telling you this, but there is a state where the marriage laws are a little looser. Utah.	Utah? Home of Americas most powerful weirdoes?
Oh, Bart. You are an extreme husband and an extreme father.	Awesome!
Bart, sweetie. I need some strawberries.	Um-hm. I bet they sell them in Utah.
Bart, I need some strawberries. Right now.	Were in the middle of the desert...
I need strawberries!!!	Take my wife... please! Hey, I finally get that joke!
Take my wife... please! Hey, I finally get that joke!	Ow!
So how many brides will you be marrying today, Mr. Simpson?	Just one.
Bart, youre too young to get married! You still make me check the closet for the boogeyman!	Maybe I found someone else to do it for me. Someone who will do a more thorough job.
I dont care how young he is -- he took advantage of a girl five years older than him!	Utah karate!
I guess this is the end for us, Bart. Thanks for everything.	Darcy, in fifty years, you might see me walking down the street and youll wonder, Is that Bart? And Ill go and youll know.
Darcy, in fifty years, you might see me walking down the street and youll wonder, Is that Bart? And Ill go and youll know.	/
Yeah, how bout that?	You know, for a while, I was kinda looking forward to bein a dad.
Son, one day youre going to be a great father.	Aww. And someday youll be one too.
Thanks, boy. Hey, for old times sake, you wanna drive me around while I sing public domain songs out the window?	You got it.
TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR / HOW I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE /	UP ABOVE THE WORLD SO HIGH / LIKE A DIAMOND IN THE SKY...
Now that Im super-wealthy, I can buy them whatever their hearts desire. Thats why rich kids turn out so well.	Mine has a cup holder!
Bart, thats a blowhole!	Youre a blowhole!
No, boy! Up, up, up!	INT. LAKESIDE MANSION - KITCHEN - PRESENT - LATER
What kind of lunch is this? A drawing of a sandwich?	Ive got Grampas medication!
No lunch for me...unless I scare one up.	Hey guys, remember to stick together. Today is the anniversary of the Dark Stanley murders.
Tell us all you know.	All right...
All right...	Imagine Im holding a flashlight under my face.
Years ago, Stanley DeGroot was a cook here at the school...	All the kids made fun of him because he never graduated from college.
STANLEY, STANLEY, NO DEGREE / TWO CREDITS SHORT AT M.I.T.!	One day, Stanley picked up a cleaver and put a new entrÃ©e on the menu.
One day, Stanley picked up a cleaver and put a new entrÃ©e on the menu.	A delectable little dish called kids-head soup.
What happened to Dark Stanley?	They hanged him for murder and buried him in an unmarked grave. When they came back the next day... the whole cemetery was missing.
Really?	Oh, Dark Stanley would never dare attack a crowded, well-lit--
Bart, my name is Doctor Swanson...	Stop right there, Doc. This school has sent me to more therapists than youve had bad dates. Ive looked at the ink blots, Ive played with the puppets, the whole rackets a hat fulla crap.
I see. Well... I get paid whether you make progress or not. Why dont we just kill the time playing videogames?	Yeah, right -- I bet youve got a bunch of learning games. Why dont you go online and look for a boyfriend while I take a nap?
Actually, I just got Death Kill City Two Death Kill Stories.	Whoa! Youve got D.K.C.2.D.K.S.? That ones rated Bad For Everyone!
You have destroyed all human life on earth. Level one complete.	Yes!
And, lastly, I need a noun.	Booger.
Booger.	Read it back! Read it back!
The county fair is always sucky to visit on a hot summer fart. You can eat delicious cotton hate. And ride the Ferris burp and the merry-go-booger.	You cant make that stuff up!
Whats this tell you, Bart?	That this is one terrible county fair.
And...	And... My Dad never takes me on the merry-go-booger. Hes always passed out in the parking snot.
Bart, I think youre making a lot of progress, but our time is up.	See ya next Wednesday.
Actually... this was our last session.	Huh? But we were doing such good work.
Oh Bart, I truly enjoyed our time together, but the school only paid for five sessions.	I think I just got dumped.
Do you think Im telling people not to have a cow because, deep down, I want them to have a cow?	I saw you yesterday in the dining room, and I didnt know if I should say hi or not.
Bart, honey, this is all we can afford for now. If it doesnt work, maybe when youre an adult you can pay some lady to make you happy for an hour.	Im pretty sure I will.
Im pretty sure I will.	...And I wasnt planned, so when I came, my parents had to get married. And they were too young and not ready for a kid to screw up their lives. Maybe... I act out because... if my parents are mad at me, they cant fight with each other!
And maybe thats why you do things like scare your classmates with Dark Stanley?	Yeah, that and Stanley was the brand of hammer my dad used to hit me with.
Very good. Bart, we have twenty minutes left. Is there anything else you want to talk about?	You know what -- I think Im good.
Oh. Good. Good. Good. Will I see you again?	Anything could happen. One of these days I might have a complete psychotic breakdown.
You redid the basement!	Whoa -- feel the pile on this shag!
Whoa -- feel the pile on this shag!	Oh, baby!
Check out this pinball machine! Chevy Chase in Foul Play.	Pinball, eh? Ive always wanted to try this.
Pinball, eh? Ive always wanted to try this.	Wow, the graphics are amazing. That ball almost seems real!
Pong!	Ping!
Pong!	Ping!
Scram, you two! This is my bedroom now!	No way, this is our rec room!
Hey, Mr. Flanders, whatd you get?	Some kind of bible garbage?
Oh, I wish! No, these are complimentary boxes from the shipping company.	Could a kid like me get these boxes? Then use em for whatever he wanted?
Only if he fibbed about his name, age, and occupation on this automated eight-hundred number.	Hello, redemption.
Why dont you put this box by your phone so you dont call the number by accident.	Oh, I wont.
So exactly what company am I giving these free boxes to?	Uh... the name of the company is...
Uh... the name of the company is...	Dog, Incorporated.
Uh-huh. Are you run by dogs or for dogs? Actually, dont answer. I like not knowing.	Now we just have to figure out what to do with these boxes.
As always, I have some ideas.	Build a fart! I love it.
Fort. Thats build a fort.	That might work too.
Whats the password?	I love my sister.
Those boxes are for shipping, not for creating a world of pure imagination. Give them back!	Not till were bored with them! Now begone!
We did it! Now we can enjoy Boxingham Palace in peace!	Want to melt it with a hose?
Oh, I get it. These are those trick candles you cant blow out.	No, Dad, theyre the opposite.
Where do the kids today get these band names? The Kinks? The Stones? Sounds like my last physical!	References.
Restage the photos?	Lisa, you fool! Youve doomed us all!
Lisa, you fool! Youve doomed us all!	Noooo!
It sure was nice of NASA to send you up again.	Oh my God!
Oh my God!	Check out whats happening behind your restaged anniversary dinner!
Duffmans on a date with Booberella!	Hes supposed to be in a stable long-term gay relationship!
The clown on this cereal box is just a person!	Theres the Rich Texan -- and his daughter, Paris Texan.
Okay boy, do something annoying. But leave yourself room to build.	Hey Paris, I saw a disgusting part of your body on the internet... your face!
Beautiful day, isnt it, Freddie? God bless you and yours.	Dad! Its Drederick Tatum. Try to get him to punch you.
Yes, but why does it have to be in my bedroom?	Lis, you cant stay here if youre gonna keep talking.
Hm... needs more goat soul.	Mom?
What are you kids doing up so late?	We just got up.
I was on the computer all night!	Actually, its Saturday.
Bart, its not Saturday.	Shhh.
Ew, I cant watch this.	Another senseless killing by... the Shadow Knight!
Bart, are you drinking?!	Mommm!
Mommm!	Youre making me look bad in front of my minions!
If they think less of you because of me, then theyre not really your minions.	I am going off to explore the Crevices of Lagrimmar.
You tell him, Jesminder!	Jumpin Johnnycakes! Those dames are cheesed.
What a fun quest! Arent you glad I made you take that nap in the middle?	Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me just put this holy grail in my trophy room.
I thought all the swords and severed heads were kind of gory so I redecorated using the Hello Kitty expansion pack.	Noooo!
Noooo!	Mom? Mom?
How could you kill your own mother?	It was just a game. A game I used to enjoy before you mommed all over it.
I think Ill go to bed.	Its five in the afternoon!
Who cares? Im dead.	Yeah, in Idaho.
Son, Ill never understand women if I live to be forty.	Big if!
You said it -- enjoy me while I last.	Wanna go slam a few beers?
Wanna watch me?	You know it.
Well, Im just the bartender here, but it seems to me you could win Lisa back by appealing to her sense of reason. And you could win your Mom back by appealing to her feelings.	Gee Moe, you give great advice.
Dont worry, honey. Ill hunt down our friends who murdered you one by one.	Whatever. Im gonna go play outside.
I got it -- I got it!	I hogged it! I hogged it!
A lazy pop fly to star shortstop Bart Simpson. And this should do it!	Now for the defining moment of my life...
Quick, Bart, Bart, get in!	Thanks, Chief.
Good morning, sweetie.	Theres nothing you can say. After that game, my life is over.
BART STINKS...	My favorite song -- ruined!
Bart, come with me. Ill take you to someone who will make you feel better.	Is it my rabbit Cottontail? The one who went to live upstate?
Bart, meet Joe LaBoot.	LaBoot, LaBoot. Sounds familiar.
My baby!	See? I hate me too! Now we can be friends again!
Jump! Who said that?	I hate Bart Simpson!
So, its dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again, as Springfield needs just one out to win the game and the championship. Whoda thunk it? Probably everyone who was here the last time.	I still cant believe it. They dusted the plate with a non-regulation brush, so we have to play the last inning over again.
I think this time itll have a happier ending.	Why do you think that?
Uh... uh... They warned me not to talk to you!	Who warned you?
Play ball.	I did it! I did it! I did it!
You make her stop! Ive had her all day!	I cant take it anymore!
Okay, heres the solution -- I want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so I cant get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief.	Why dont you just quit taking the pills, you hophead?
I have three kids and no money! Why cant I have no kids and three money?	Why am I sleeping when right next door is every boys dream a fat, suggestible zombie dad.
Why am I sleeping when right next door is every boys dream a fat, suggestible zombie dad.	Hey zombie -- wanna come out and play?
Zombie kill.	No, play!
My stomach is groaning with walnut meat.	Cmon, just one more.
Is that one?	Thats a guy with red hair.
Look at me! Im a fireman!	Hey, Mom, can we go see Dad put out the fire?
So Daddy saved Apu and Moe, and believe me, we learned our lesson.	Whatd you do with all the loot?
Springfield squash -- the most fibrous variety of yellow squash!	We drove fifty miles to look at a stupid pile of vegetables?
Thats it, buster -- you just bought yourself ten minutes watching that man make a wagon wheel.	Yesm.
Wagon wheels were the internet of the nineteenth century!	Really?
Where the hell is Abigail Adams?! Oh, there she is. Where the hell is Mary Todd Lincoln?! Oh, shes right there. Where the hell is Ida Saxton McKinley?! Oh I see. Where the hell is--	Dad, look, a corn maze!
Finally! I knew we could solve that maze using Tremauxs algorithm.	Told you.
No you didnt -- your plan was to burn the corn.	That was never my plan.
Um... I dont think hes ever thought about anything.	Santas Little Helper would be an awesome police dog! Can he, Dad? Can he?
No. And never bring it up again.	Please, can he?
Whats the matter, Bart?	Boy, it is gonna be so cool when youre a police dog...
Boy, it is gonna be so cool when youre a police dog...	Good boy! Now, transform!
Okay, since the dogs not here, Im gonna take you for a walk.	I miss Santas Little Helper. I wanted him to be a police dog, but now he has no time for me. I even have to eat my own homework!
Listen man, you gotta let it go. Relax for a couple days with your family. Come back fresh on Monday.	Boy, youre back!
Boy, youre back!	Ow! You bit me! My own dog bit me.
I love Santas Little Helper, but I dont know if we can have him in our home anymore.	Mom, you cant send him away! Hes a dog, not Grampa!
Forget it, kid -- hes a cop now.	Well, I bet he cant resist this.
Well, I bet he cant resist this.	Fetch, boy!
Fetch, boy!	My God. Ive lost him.
No street curs!	Thats it! I want a snake!
It says here dont bother naming them. Snakes have poor hearing and only live to strangle.	I like it -- Strangles. Hey Lis, wanna touch Strangles? Hes not slimy at all. Hes scaly.
Ew! He is slimy!	Thats because I soaked him in slime!
Bart Simpson, you cant bring a python to school!	Hey, dont ask me to show if you cant handle the tell.
Sometimes I forget why youre chief... but I remember now! You follow your heart, boy!	Here, Strangles! Strangles?
Aw man, its like some chemicals cut one.	Strangles, you came to save me!
Strangles, you came to save me!	Santas Little Helper, you came too!
Santas Little Helper, you came too!	Sorry... but a boys gotta go with his dog.
No deal.	Okay, suit yourself -- its not like you have any major events coming up that the bullies would want to disrupt.
Okay, you have a deal, you conniving little...	Wow, thats a swear?
Used as a noun it is.	Sweet. Now Im gonna need some wheels.
Chloe, I need those schematics now!	What? Who is this?
Im Jack Bauer, who the hell are you?	Me? Uh, Im... Ahmed Adoody.
SKIP TO MY LOU, MY DARLING...	Hey Nelson, what gives? Martin just skipped past you singing Skip to my Lou, and you did nothing!
Im unclear on what you want!	Is Martin working for Jimbo?!
Yes!	Yes what?
Yes sir.	Lisa... are you on a secure line?
I am. Youre on a Bluetooth cell phone, the most vulnerable device known to man.	But it looks so cool. Listen, theres a mole inside CTU.
A mole?!	Yes, a mole. Now I dont have much time, so Im just gonna come right out and say his name, so get ready to know his name. His name is the following M--
Bart, are you all right? Bart?	Hey, Im fine -- They havent made a French horn yet that can hurt me. Now, Im sending you a picture of the bomb.
My God, thats a class-five stench-dispersal unit! We have to short out that fan.	HDW. Whats that?
Thats the main valve of the hot dog water recirculation system. Theres over thirty years of wiener soakings in there.	Lis, you have to release that water. Its the only way to short out the fan.
You butcher!	The hot dog waters gonna push us into the fan!
Bart, Ive got an idea! As youre dyin, jam the blades with your spine!	Keep pitching, Ill be back.
Thank goodness this crisis was averted. Nicely done, Lisa.	Hey, what about me?
Hey, what about me?	I almost died... and so did Willie.
Good work, Lisa.	What about me?
Almost ready! Here we go.	Lets get this show on the road, man. We got things to do.
Okay. Hold still. This is the last picture on the role.	Praise the Lord.
Oh hi, kids. Youre just in time to go to the dentist!	Dentist?! You said we were going to ride dirt bikes around the cemetery!
Heres a free toothbrush -- keep those teeth clean!	So youre saying I should do your job, for you, at home, for free. You wish.
Dr. Bart.	Lets see... according to your charts, youre due for your annual throat scraping.
Uh-oh, Im feelin a lotta cooties down there. We may need to replace a tooth.	Now rinse...
Now rinse...	Finally, Im gonna take an x-ray, so lie perfectly still for twenty minutes.
Sure do. Lets go get ice cream!	I cant wait to get the freshness out of my mouth!
Oh my God, this is amazing! Wait, Im gonna be driving. Ill go for the cup.	Dad!
Which one?	Uh... Ill Etch-A-Sketch it for you.
Uh... Ill Etch-A-Sketch it for you.	Etch... sketch... etch... sketch...
Shake it! Shake it!	It wont come off!
Im not sure Brockmans out of the woods yet. There are a lot of religious watch-dog groups out there... keeping the world safe from the horror of free expression.	You mean there are losers who spend all day watching TV looking for stuff to complain about? Whod be lame enough to do that?
Oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!	Dad, you barely go to work at all.
Dinner with Mr. Burns! What a waste of my precious, precious Saturday night.	Hey Dad, have fun with your boyfriend.
If youre gonna film me, I insist on a body double.	Is Uncle Fester still alive?
Will you shut up? I cant hear the song in my head!	Do you wanna get a reaction shot of his ass?
Yay, Dad!	We knew you could do it!
Good luck on your first day, Dad.	Give em hell, Homer.
Find out if he has a wife! We could double date!	Yay, Dad!
Dont do it! Dont do it!	Dad?
I couldnt bear to tell your mother, so I hang out here all day.	But Dad, youve gotta tell her. Shes been buying brand-name groceries.
Brands like Misers Choice and Day-Old Delights?	No, things rich people buy, like Campbells Soup and Pepsodent.
Dennys.	Every place has such a long line.
Forget it! One day a week I should be able to put on nice clothes and have someone bring food to me!	Theres a place -- with no line!
Look at the crowd around that table.	It must be a make-your-own sundae bar!
Wheres Bart?	Mahogany. Great movie, great casket.
I miss my Pop-pop.	I miss him too.
I miss him too.	Whats your name?
Donny.	Youre Donny? Pop-pop said that after he died you should give me ten bucks a week. Starting now.
Okay.	Um, listen, Im outta town next week, so...
My back! It hurts, and not in a good way!	Well, time to move on with our lives.
When Homer is on his back, his stomach lodges perfectly under his diaphragm, giving him a powerful singing voice.	Is that a real thing?
Woo-hoo!	Dad, you were great!
It aint candy, its a lamb chop wrapped in foil.	Hey mom, do all conductors carry poisoned blow-darts in their pocket?
Singing opera made me good at painting.	Is that a real thing?
Oh, I dont want to bother the internet with my problem.	Aw, cmon, Mom, well help you surf.
Click that one, Mom. / No, go up! / Keep going, up, up, up! / The blue ones are ads! / Thats the toolbar! / Now youve opened Word! Close it. / Close it, dont save it! / Stop clicking! / Dont go there! / Why are you buying a freezer?!	Dont click the cart, or you bought it!
Okay, Ill sign up.	You just bought another freezer!
Guess what, boy. Last night I towed your principals car.	Awesome! Hows he getting around?
Got one.	We can say these swears any time we want because theyre in the Bible!
I dont think Leviticus is a swear.	Shut the Hell up, you damn ass whore.
Bart?	Uh-oh.
Im starting to worry about your father.	Well, I know he seems to get dumber every year, but lately hes plateaued.
Wow, Bart! Lookin good!	Well, I have to look good for tomorrow.
What?! Name twelve.	Well, just this week, theres been field day, picking me up from the airport...
Dont worry, sir. Ill handle this cleanly, quietly and Bart!	What?
Why do you think Im kicking it?	Are you guys fighting over us?
No. You hit me in my seven hundred testicles.	Why did you come to our world?
My friends and I came in peace to find your vulnerabilities and, um, shore them up with more peace. Yes. Then I was accidentally left behind... in a spirit of peace.	Whoa. Is that a ray gun?
Oh my God, an alien! Im gonna blow Rachel Goodman away at show-and-tell!	No! If the government finds out hes here, theyll dissect him!
No.	Can I tighten the--
I said no!	I thought we were supposed to do this together.
Actually, I do have an important job for you. You can go get the wrench I dropped.	Im helping! Im helping!
But some of my best friends are... fine, you can stay.	Look!
Look!	Theyre coming for-- Whats your name?
Ha, you missed them! Bart and our alien friend are hundreds of miles away by now.	What do you weigh? Like a million pounds?
We could... or...	You killed them.
What do we do now?	Hear me out. It seems to me we gave her a choice trick or treat. She didnt give us a treat, so...
Bart, where are you heading with this?	Trick or Treat isnt just some phrase you chant mindlessly like The Lords Prayer. Its an oral contract!
I told you not to mock me at picnics.	Why give em the choice? That trick was sweeter than any treat well get tonight.
Oh, lighten up. Its Halloween -- a night for mischief and merriment.	Trick-or-treat! Lick my feet! Your head smells like pig-butt meat!
You over-fed them! Youre the worst one of all!	Whoa! They turned the church into a haunted house!
Welcome to Heck House! Youre about to discover what a life of sin will get you!	Sin gets us something? Awesome!
Nooo!	He died as he lived -- like a dork.
Attention, everyone... Luann and I have some big news.	Is it that youre brother and sister? Because you really look a lot alike.
No.	Half-brother and half-sister?
No.	Siamese twins whove been surgically separated?
Oh, thats great.	Cool.
Great story, Mr. Simpson.	But why do all your bedtime stories have commercials in them for the container store?
Where does it go?	Only one way to find out.
Oh my God! I said I didnt care if they ever came back! This is my fault!	Drown, monster, drown!
Drown, monster, drown!	Hey who died?
My parents, probably.	So you guys arent ice cream men?
Thisll cheer you up. Ill let you kill me in Bar Brawl Four Final Fracas.	Uh-oh. I slipped on some blood. Im totally vulnerable to a full-body jukebox slam.
Uh-oh. I slipped on some blood. Im totally vulnerable to a full-body jukebox slam.	Come on, its easy. Just push A, B, up, up, left trigger, right trigger, and both triggers at once.
Haw-haw, you know Milhouse.	Okay, everyone. My best friend is a little messed up, so everyone be extra nice to him.
Looks like youre not the coolest kid in school anymore.	Hey, Im happy to see Milhouse get some hand-on-hand action. But no one is cooler than Bartholomew J. Simpson.
Really? See ya at lunch.	Anyone want to sit over here? You can have my pizza crust.
Anyone want to sit over here? You can have my pizza crust.	Young man, you look like you enjoy fun and excitement.
Come on! Look at me, Im cool. Ive got my backpack on frontwards, and Im krumping!	Check it out! This image has not been sped up.
Oh my God, look at these poll numbers.	Aye Carumba! Oh man. Milhouse has gone from being a comic figure to a tragic one.
Aye Carumba! Oh man. Milhouse has gone from being a comic figure to a tragic one.	If he could go back to being happy, I could go back to being cool.
Lets see... Milhouse would be happy again if he had family to take care of him. Family, family...	Every Christmas... Milhouse gets Danish butter cookies from... Solvang, California... where he has a beloved un... ...cle!
Directory assistance for Solvang, a little bit of Denmark on Californias central coast. ... We have three Van Houtens.	Fine. Ill call three numbers. What are they?
Okay, so which one of these losers is Milhouses Uncle Norbert?	Norbert? Norbert? Oh, this guys a total Norbert.
Bart? Im Norbert Van Houten. But everyone calls me Zack.	Youre Uncle Norbert?
And Im here to find my nephew, Nerdletaub Z. Pantybottom. Let us join forces.	Would you be my uncle?
I promise you wont be alone anymore, son.	And that takes care of that.
And that takes care of that.	Oh man, now hes even more popular!
Hes troubled, but I can save him!	Oh, for cryin out loud.
Bart, Bart, Bart. Youre worried youre losing Milhouse. And love is a selfish thing.	Shut up! I dont love Milhouse.
Oh really? The more you deny it, the more I know its true.	Oh yeah? Well when youre mean, Im a trampoline, so everything you said goes back and hits your ugly head.
God, that was lame! Where did you get that?!	From Milhouse! I love him so much!
Goodbye, old life.	Wait, Milhouse! Dont go! Youre my best friend.
I have to go.	Then Im going with you!
Bart, climb up!	I cant!
Well, what do you think of Mr. Johnsons rope-climbing class now?	Still sucks!
Mom and Dad!	Mr. and Mrs. Van Houten!
Lame, lame, lame, lame, have it, lame, Superman Dies, Aquaman Dies, Casper Dies, Caveman Robin, Black Robin, Born-Again Robin...	Whoa! The infamous Wolverine comic with pop-out claws!
I hate when they tell me things about themselves.	You should stop being so mean to us kids.
That was an imaginary story -- dreamt by Jimmy Olsen after he was kicked in the head by Supergirls horse, Comet. It never really happened!	None of these things ever really happened.
/ Whoa, hes so cool! /	All right, I get it.
All right, I get it.	Youre cool, youre not mainstream, you wear a porkpie hat...
Mmm... porkpie.	...but lets see what you know about super-heroes.
Hey, Im all about the capes! Flame on!	Whos stronger? The Thung or The Mulk? And show your work.
Woo, boy, thats a tough one. What do you think?	You want to know what I think?
Does Galactus eat planets? Of course I do.	Wow. I was in such a bad relationship with my ex-Comic Book Guy. Id forgotten how good it could be!
Mm-hm.	Alan Moore, you wrote my favorite issues of Radioactive Man!
Oh really. So you like that I made your favorite superhero a heroin-addicted jazz critic whos not radioactive?	I dont read the words. I just like when he punches people. How do you make his costume stick so close to his muscles?
Whoa! You would sell weapons of the orient to children? That is weak.	Face the facts, has-been. This man is the comic book guy our town deserves!
Kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother.	You had your hot dog plumped?
Then it was all a dream. I never became a hideous monster.	The only person who thinks youre a monster is the one who had to give you a sponge bath.
I sure have. Plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasnt been perfected to where you look really good. When it is, everyone should get it.	Amen.
And the easiest placemat puzzle in the state...	Lemme at it!
Oh dear -- Sideshow Bob, hoist on his own petard.	Oh great, here it comes -- all the boring things youve done since the last time you didnt kill us.
Bear with me...	Yeah, yeah, weve all been to England. Is this going somewhere?
...I plead not guilty, by reason of insanity! Insanity caused by my persecution at the hands of this young boy.	Young? Im the oldest kid in my class! By like two years.
He cheats at Uno!	Bobs playing all of you like saps. This mans a killer!
ITS FULL OF EXTRA FEATURES / AND DELETED SCENES / LIKE WHEN YOU FELL AND SPLIT YOUR PANTS / AND WE SAW YOUR FRANK AND BEANS.	Oh my God, its beautiful! Are you buying this?
Bart, I know this is nuts, but try to look sad.	Im not sad. I have nothing to be sad about. Nothing!
I once felt that way, too.	Hey, arent you Bobs brother?
Biologically, yes, but we never got along. He was always zigging when I zagged. That summer when he wanted to tour the castles of Italy, I wanted to tour the castles of France. So we went to Spain, a compromise that satisfied no one.	Thats stupid. You talk like youre smart, but youre stupid.
Anyway, I choose to remember Bob as the big brother who taught me to play Botticelli.	Sounds boring.
Oh, youd love it! Its a guessing game in which one player adopts the guise of a noteworthy-- youre right, it is boring. But the only way youll find happiness is by making your peace with Bob.	Well, I guess I could say goodbye.
Hey Bart! Youre on the front page of the paper.	Im going to set things right. Wanna come with me?
Im going to set things right. Wanna come with me?	Cool, I found a trapdoor that leads to an underground city. Here I go!
Then lets give the people what they want!	Ahhhhh! Sideshow Bob!
Zeuss pimples!	Hot! Hot! Hot!
Damn these glorious gunboats!	Nice try, Bob -- but you didnt count on one thing.
Whats that?	You stink like my butt! Take him away!
Hmmm... The only thing that still doesnt make sense is why the dog attacked me.	Because you never feed him, walk him or let him out to pee.
But wont that just shift the burden to your children?	No, you idiot. We just pay for it with another bond issue.
No, you idiot. We just pay for it with another bond issue.	Let her figure out someone to dump it on.
And Ralph is only eight years old! It says in the Constitution you have to be thirty-five.	The Constitution? Im pretty sure the Patriot Act killed it to ensure our freedoms.
I thought global warming would take care of it. Al Gore cant do anything right.	I got some old magazines to burn. Popular Science, Redbook, Big and Tall Halloween Costume catalogue...
I got some old magazines to burn. Popular Science, Redbook, Big and Tall Halloween Costume catalogue...	Next item...
Mom, I didnt know you went to college!	Yeah, you always said that after high school, Dad blessed you with the unplanned miracle of me.
You know, Mom and Dad are almost forty, and Bart is ten. That means you didnt have him until way after high school.	Yeah, what happened while I was chillin in Dads junk?
There is a part of our past that we havent told you kids about. A turbulent part.	Cmon. More turbulent than now?
Things happened between your mother and me that were not proud of. It was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.	The nineties? Never heard of it.
What did I miss? How did it end?	Did you two ever get back together?
Bart, no, its Valentines Day.	Okay... but if Dad kisses Mom too much, a stork will lay an angel egg in her tummy, and the next thing you know we find a baby brother in the cabbage patch! Heres a thumbnail sketch
I filed it under G.	We wanna hear a story!
Even love is boring when youre stuck in a tunnel of it. Why cant this be the Tunnel of Hockey Fights?	Well Ive got a Valentines Day story! Its about musicians from a simpler time. The era of The Brady Bunch, Donny and Marie, and...
Mo-om!	The system works!
Just sit down, Bart.	Huh?
Huh?	Whos the new meat in my seat?
When he grows up, I want to be like me.	Look, new kid, Im the head hamster in this habitrail. Capeesh?
Well maybe theres a new guinea pig in your cage. Capeesh that?	Oh, I capeesh. I capeesh just fine.
Wanna take a ride with your old man?	No.
Cmon. Cmon. Oh cmon.	Oh fine.
Whats the matter, son?	Theres this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me.
Aw, dont give up, boy. I believe in you -- and not just because I have to.	Really, Dad?
Son, I know when we first met, we didnt really hit it off. But since then, Ive really come to respect you. And unlike love, respect cant be bought.	Youre right. Im gonna go to school tomorrow and show everyone Im awesome.
Young man, my office, now!	Why did you take the rap for me?
I dont know. I like your style.	Well, remember this Bart Simpson takes care of his friends.
Well, remember this Bart Simpson takes care of his friends.	Come see me when you get out.
Young man, Im gonna be on you like a numerator on a denominator!	Lets take a ride. I got a place with a view.
Ive never seen blue vines before!	Theyre only sold in Europe. I know a guy.
Oh yeah, you can really taste the blue.	Check this out.
Oh thats so cool!	Heres a little hair of the dog for tomorrow.
Oh, thanks, Bart.	Gentlemen, this is an ostrich egg.
Gentlemen, this is an ostrich egg.	Now that were buddies, I can let you in on some of the cool scams we run at school.
Oh yeah, like what?	Bathroom passes, doctors notes...
Whoa, Sherri! Im in.	Milhouse, bust out four of our finest juice boxes.
Milhouse, bust out four of our finest juice boxes.	I just wanna say... juice box fight!
Sounds like fun. Can I play?	Sure.
Two whistles! Im one whistle away from three whistles, people!	All right, heres the plan we go in there, fill the coffee pot with crickets from this bag labeled crickets and leave.
I have some information ye might be interested in. It wont be easy to hear.	Because of your stupid accent?
Nach-nae. Because of its upsetting nature. Skinners gotten to someone close to ye. A rat!	Who is it?
But Skinners goin to meet the rat right now!	Thanks, Willie!
Got im.	Where am I?
Uhhh, Bart, where we going?	Gentlemen, someone I thought I could trust is a rat.
Now lets see, is it my best friend? My other best friend? Or a kid I just met?	Donny...
Donny...	Grab Milhouses legs. Hes the rat!
Grab Milhouses legs. Hes the rat!	You grew tired of always being in my shadow.
No, I like your shadow. Its nice and cool.	Dont worry, well get him out in a couple hours.
Ahhhhh...	Normally, you cant even buy these. You have to buy the ostrich and wait.
How much of this is gunk?	The whole insides.
Say Simpson, would you mind holding one end of this banner while I put it up?	My pleasure, sir.
Well see whos laughing when your house is smeared with ostrich albumen.	Donnys the rat!
Where do you think youre going?	Ah get back to your knitting, Seymour.
Hey Bart, uh, what are we doing here?	Theres been a change of plans. I was gonna tell you, but then I remembered... youre the rat!
No, no, no -- youve got it all wrong!	Skinners tongue was blue!
Blue! From the vines you gave him!	Whyd you do it, man?
Im sorry, Bart.	You were like a brother to me! We were gonna take woodshop together and make nunchucks. And then take people to our lockers and show them our nunchucks!
Fizz me?	A funny thing happens when you mix Mentos with Diet Coke...
Now imagine that... times a million!	And its all gonna go down in Skinners office.
Sorry to plop, plop on your fizz, fizz.	What are you doing here?
It was rats within rats -- which was also me dinner last night!	Willie?! Youre on Skinners side?
Hey, we should get together some time. You know, to make nunchucks.	Sweet.
What?! Im not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.	Whatcha doin, Mom? Goin crazy?
Now thats enough, you each got one in.	Aw, But hers was better!
You wrote a report on it last week!	The internet wrote it -- I just handed it in.
The internet wrote it -- I just handed it in.	Whoa, check that out!
Whoa, check that out!	Cool, the strong kicking the weaks butt.
Excavating for arrowheads!	Dude, its Saturday, what kind of a freak wastes his--
Care to make it a trio, Bart? You can brush and I can blow!	Well, I agree you blow.
Then its a plan.	A lot of people blow, but no one blows like you.
High praise indeed!	When you look up blow in the dictionary--
Bart, hes not gonna get it!	Fine.
A bone?! It could be one of the major homos!	Youre one of the major...
Bart! You cant just run away from this!	Youre right.
Youre right.	I can bike away much faster -- and ring the bell to drown out bad thoughts!
Bart, Martin could be seriously hurt, or worse.	Youre right. We have to do something. Lets watch TV!
Oh my God!	Were murderers!
Were murderers!	Im filled with rue!
Uh... lets think about this. Martins gone, but it was an accident. Ruining our lives wont bring him back.	Lisa! Youre saying we shouldnt tell the truth?
Jimbo, stop that!	Usually when I do something bad, I feel good. But not this time. Martin was like Jesus -- only real!
What do you mean whats up? Why would something be up?	Yeah, nothings up and nothings down -- except for Martin, who died.
Nothing!	Nothing!
Act like youre shopping! We cant be seen together.	But were brother and sister.
Give me an Indian burn!	But...
You like pranks, dont you, dingus?	I like pranks. Everyone likes pranks. Even Dr. Hibbert.
...whatever the heck youre doing.	Im tending to Martins butterfly enclosure. His butterflies are emerging from their chrysalises tonight.
Im tending to Martins butterfly enclosure. His butterflies are emerging from their chrysalises tonight.	You said you wanted to end it all.
You said you wanted to end it all.	Dad, look! Raccoons!
Dad, look! Raccoons!	By which I meant bring Martins butterfly project to completion.
I cant take it anymore! The stress is killing me! Im on a freight train to Crazytown!	Calm down!
What was that?	The butterflies are hatching!
Now if I may mimic your mothers feeding call... CLAWDY-CLAW, CLICKETY-CLOO, CLAWDY-CLAW...	Thank you.
I thought I turned that tape off.	Maybe you just put it on auto-reverse.
I almost flicked an innocent butterfly. Bart, were turning into monsters!	Cool!
You almost got away with it, but heres where you got sloppy shouting out that you did it.	Oh man, Im too pretty to go to jail. You dont know how lucky you are.
I learned that beneath my goody two-shoes lie some very dark socks.	And I learned that killing a nerd is not as fun as it sounds.
The last book in the series goes on sale at midnight, and were gonna go stand in line.	Wait in line for a book? You tell em Bart says Hey.
Cmon, boy. All the nerds are doin it.	Im not a nerd -- Im a jock whos too cool for sports.
Son, while your mother and little mother are out, Im gonna let you in on a deep dark family secret.	You have a drinking problem?
Have you ever wondered what I do in that locked room?	Gay out?
Well wonder no more!	Dad... marinating with you is cool.
You talk a good game -- but do you have the product to back it up?	Step into our Jerkatorium.
Step into our Jerkatorium.	What the?!
Wait, wait, wait, wait! You havent seen our Power Point presentation. Bart?	J -- Just the product you need. E -- Excellent value. R -- Retailers dream. K--
Who could have done this?!	Well, something chewed through the cellar door... and the floor is covered with paw prints...
Enjoy your jerky laced with sleeping pills... nobody outwits Homer Simpson... Hey, theyre not sleepy. Theyre just turning fuzzy...	Homer, you ate their jerky.
That wasnt a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal.	Oh yeah? They made you build this statue.
Oh yeah? They made you build this statue.	Dad! Dad, a little help?
Come on out, boy.	For the next three days Im gonna stick to you like waffle syrup on a shag rug. Im gonna be on you like fish stink on a Gloucester dog. Im gonna be all over you like-- Hey, whered she go?
Okay, Bart, its time for operation crazy-plan. Step one we chuck the raccoon in there.	What if someone catches him?
And I realize its wrong to try to live your career dreams through your children.	Does that mean I can stop training to be a Mexican wrestler?
Come on, preen harder! Make them hate you! You feed on their hatred... and you are so hungry!	No me gusto. Que lastima.
Hey Dad, thats the singer you used to manage!	Oh, right. Dad was Colonel Homer and he wore that awesome suit and Lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out! But I forget how Mom felt about it...
Just kiddin. Its actually chicken.	Well I think its wonderful. My diet starts tomor-row!
Southern-fried succubus?	Hee-Haw Ho?
What lap?	Yeah, all I see is a gut with knees!
Lurleens daddy comes back after thirty years and hes father of the year. Why cant I leave for thirty years?	Fine with me. Look, I packed you a bag.
Well... it might be cold outside.	No problem. I bought you a hat.
YEAH, DADDYS BACK AND IM FEELIN LIKE A DAUGHTER...	DADDYS BACK AND SHES FEELIN LIKE SHE OUGHTER!
Yeah, me too. Since her father re-abandoned her, shes cut the word pop out of all of our foods.	Youd think a house full of crazy people would be fun. Its actually really depressing.
Hurry... Guess no ones buying my cereal... Buy or Ill die!	Mom! We need to throw out all this Krusty cereal and get Robot-Clown cereal!
Mom! We need a Callaway titanium perimeter-weighted driver!	It adds yards to any swing!
And Bart, you go with your father to Shelbyville to get the beanbag chairs re-beaned.	I hate the beanbag store. The clerks are always shouting in Hebrew on their cell phones.
Thats right.	But Wikipedia said he was passionate about rehearsal.
Dont you worry about Wikipedia -- well change it when we get home. Well change a lot of things.	Hey, check it out!
Hey, check it out!	I wouldnt mind driving that over a prairie dog village! Honk to the driver!
I wouldnt mind driving that over a prairie dog village! Honk to the driver!	Martin?! Whats a tool like you doing on something cool like that?
Im operating a Combine Harvester. Its part of my duties as a member of 4-H.	4-H club? Is it dangerous?
Indeed! It has the most finger loss of any youth organization.	Can I join, Dad? Can I? Can I? Can I?
Whoa. I didnt come here today expecting to fall in love.	Hey, its the runt. Ill take anything but the runt.
Hey, its the runt. Ill take anything but the runt.	Awww... looks like were partners. Youre a scrappy little misfit, just like me... Anyone want to trade? No reasonable offer refused. Ill take a chicken!
Pullet, Bantam, Orpington, Pullet, Flemish Giant, Pullet, Leghorn...	Keep it down! Im trying to feed my runt.
Here, Ill show you what to do.	Im Bart, and this is my calf, Lulubelle.
Uh... you know thats a boy, right?	Oh. I thought she was peeing out of her nipple.
How bout you just call him Lou?	Thats great, it rhymes with moo!
Well, I dont know much about cows, but I think we have a winner!	Youre the greatest cow in the world! Im gonna be your friend forever!
Bart... you do know what happens next.	Something happens next?
Son, your calf is gonna be taken to a feedlot...	Lots of feed, that sounds good.
...then slaughtered.	But he won! Why dont you kill the loser cows?
Honey... wed love to, but... a prize-winning bull is thousands of dollars.	Oh man.
Bart, are you all right?	I hear Lou mooing in my head!
What you heard was your conscience telling you to stop eating meat.	If I could save Lou, Id never eat meat again. Not even prosciutto and melon!
All right, so I put that there to get you to stop eating meat. But your body is going to miss the protein. So youll have to take these pills.	Sorry Lis, I cant be a vegetarian -- I love the taste of death! But please, help me get my cow back.
Okay. Meet me halfway -- stop stirring your lemonade with a sausage.	Give me a minute.
Its a no-brainer.	Okay.
Good to see you, Windsong.	Windsong?
Yeah, its my code name. This is Compost. And this is Solarpanel.	Whats my code name?
Forgive us for this violation, Mother Fence. We honor your chain-link spirit.	Lou! Lou!
Lou! Lou!	Lou! Where are you, little buddy?
Of course he did. His food is laced with growth hormones.	I dont care how much of a pumped-up freak you are, I still love you. The way Barry Bondss kids probably still love him.
Wow, you did learn a lot at 4-H.	Hell, yeah!
Well, your friend Mary from 4-H lives on a farm -- Lou can stay with her!	Hmmm, a cow on a farm... With a moo moo here, and a moo moo there... Yes, it works!
Hmmm, a cow on a farm... With a moo moo here, and a moo moo there... Yes, it works!	All right, Lou! To freedom! Lou?
He wants to know your name.	Oh, Im Bart Simpson. Is Mary here?
Hey, Bart.	I didnt know Cletus was your dad.
She had a regular city birth in a gas station!	The feedlot wants to kill Lou and I cant keep him. Can I give him to you?
And I have dreams. I got fifteen-eighty on my D.Q.A.T.	D.Q.A.T.?
I wish I had a tail what did swat away flies. Mine just hangs there.	All right, sir, Ill marry your daughter.
Aw, you just got cold feet - cause you barefoot and our floors made of mud.	Have you seen my sister?
No, and shes cutting it pretty close... were about ten minutes away from You may kiss the bride.	Kiss?! I thought we were just getting married!
Do you, Bart Simpson, take Mary Wrestlemania Spuckler to be your lawful wedded wife, for as long as you both shall reckon?	I do.
How could you say that?! I starved myself to get into this dress!	No, no, no, no, no -- you look great, honey. Mom, if I dont get married, theyll take Lou.
Sweetie, dont you think your Mom might have a trick up her sleeve?	No.
Dont worry, Bart -- in India, your cow will be treated like a God and receive the food and medical care that in America would go to human beings.	Lou, if that plane leaves the ground and youre not on it, youll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and definitely after they kill you and make you into sloppy Joes.
Lou, if that plane leaves the ground and youre not on it, youll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and definitely after they kill you and make you into sloppy Joes.	Heres looking at you, cud.
Anything?	No, everything is better.
No, everything is better.	Anything! / Everything! / Anything! / Everything!
All right, time to dig in. I brought everything we need.	Its just forks and plates. Didnt we bring any food?
The food is all around us.	You brought us here to beg?
Im making a documentary about a very special family.	Smithers and Burns?
Homie, shes not making a snuggle film.	Ew, Lisa, make them stop!
You know these guys?	Ive never seen them before.
You stupid kid! What if I walked in here barefoot?	You did, Dad.
Proudly edited by Lisa Simpson!	Lisa, your movie exposed our crappy side to the world. I knew you were lame, but I never imagined you were bogus.
Quirky? Quirky is a grandma who gives people the finger! You made us look like monsters!	Monsters! Monsters! Monsters!
I never wanted to be famous for being mean. I wanted to be famous for catching Santa Claus.	Lets just go back to the condo -- we have to wash the dishes and do the sheets so its nice for the next people.
I know! Kinda miss it.	I know! Well be in another movie -- and this time well act really bad!
Mom, you tricked us!	We thought this was gonna be a fun trip to the mall!
I wanna go lecture the food court businesses that are still using Styrofoam!	Lead-based toys! Lead-based toys!
For once, well do what Maggie wants.	Maggies thing? She wont even remember that we did it!
None of you kids ever remember any of the nice things we do for you.	Like what?
Food?	Pass.
Shelter?	That dump?
Clothing?	I wouldnt blow my nose into this.
We fooled her... Betsy.	Bart is awesome.
Bart is awesome.	Wow -- this guy could put Milhouse out of business.
Dont worry -- Im ready for this. Bart, fetch The Defender.	Yes, sir!
Why would a robber make pie?	Who cares? If you kill him, well be on TV!
Wow, Dad was so cute as a baby.	When did he lose his cuteness?
Say something comforting.	Okay, comforting, comforting... Uh Dad, whenever I would hang out with Grandma, she would always ask me about you. And Id say you suck, and she would say... you dont suck that bad.
She said I didnt suck?	That bad.
That bad. Wow.	Yeah.
To my grandson Bart, I leave my Swiss army knife.	Cool.
Grandma, I accept your gift.	You got nothing! You got nothing!
Mom, Im so sorry. You just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. Well, if I get out of this I promise you Ill grant your last wish.	Homer! Hey, Homer!
Homer! Hey, Homer!	Heres Grammas knife!
As long youre willing to sign a twenty year personal services contract where I get ninety-nine percent of all your earnings.	I am so gonna try out for that!
Me too! But I hope you get it.	No, I hope you get it.
Well I really hope you get it.	Yeah, I hope I get it too. Later!
OWWWWWWWW!	For my first impression...

The Inverted Double-struck Penny, or Kissing Lincolns...	I dont know why I agreed to this.
My counter-offer Radioactive Man Meets the Kansas City Royals.	How bout Radioactive Man versus Restless Leg Syndrome?
Let us try a different tack. Are you interested in coin collecting?	Am I?! No.
Son... all hobbies suck. But if you keep at it, you might find at the end that youve managed to kill some precious time.	Wow, I never thought of it like that.
Do you wanna collect coins with your old man?	You bet I do.
One of these has got to be that smooching Lincoln penny.	Nope... Nope... Dime... Button... Pepperoni slice...
This is a classic nineteen seventy-eight Pizza Hut! Mmm... terrible.	Nope... Nope... Nope...
Sir, the promise of cash is not an enticement. The current bid is five hundred dollars. Do I hear a counter bid? Going once... going twice...	Dad?
Aaaaannnnnd done.	Now, lets put it on a shelf and never look at it again.
Woo hoo! St. Patricks Day!	I love how they made the river green!
Oh, come on people, your drunken shenanigans destroy this town every year. And Ireland is so much more than the imbibing of spirits. The Irish gave the world the paddy wagon, the shamrock shake, and folk dancing where you dont move your arms.	Wheres the I.R.A. when you need em?
Its his penis.	Two kinds of Irish people? What are they fighting over? Who gets to sleep in the bathtub?
Here you go, son. Shell casings.	Whoa! Theres still bullets in some of these!
Point them away from your sisters when you hammer them.	Yes sir!
Because you love the taste of my imaginary tea.	Youre right!
Hey Spaz, while you were here spazzing yourself, you totally missed out.	Missed out? I didnt miss out. Whatd I miss out on?
Missed out? I didnt miss out. Whatd I miss out on?	I wish I had a cell phone.
Heres an imaginary cell phone.	What, do you think Im crazy?
What, do you think Im crazy?	Mom, even Milhouse has a cell phone! Your son is lamer than Milhouse! What does that say about you?!
Here you go.	Dont tell me where I go. A dollar? What for?
Its the least I can do -- these balls cost five dollars new.	So I can get a dollar for every ball I find?! Then if a cell phone costs one hundred dollars, how many balls do I need?
Ill fix you, ya varmint!	Wow, Im just twenty balls away from a cell phone!
So its you! Youre the one whos been poachin on me territory.	Groundskeeper Willie?
Weekends and summers, Im Greenskeeper Willie. Your ball-scavengin days are over! And those orphan golf balls belong to me!	This phone belongs to Denis Leary!
Dimpled gold! Im rich! Now I wont have to pleasure a country-club wife to get me steak dinner.	Im never gonna get a cell phone!
Dammit!	Huh? A cell phone!
Huh? A cell phone!	Its mine! Cool! And you can even watch commercials on it.
Well, I know you dont have a cell phone, so you must be in your kitchen or one of your bedrooms. Unless you have a wall jack in your basement -- that would be huge.	Look outside your window.
Im not supposed to look out the window when Im alone.	Just do it!
Lets assign each other ringtones!	That felt good.
That felt good.	Hello?... you want Denis Leary? Wrong number, dumbass.
Come on Denis, its me, producer Brian Grazer. I just paid five million dollars for the screen rights to the book Everybody Poops.	Im a big fan.
Only one face came to mind for the constipated gorilla -- yours.	Sure -- on one condition. I wanna do my own poops.
I wouldnt have it any other way.	Of course Ill do it for minimum. Great. Ill see you next Monday in Tunisia.
Of course Ill do it for minimum. Great. Ill see you next Monday in Tunisia.	Yo. Whos this?
Dennis Leary? Boston comedian turned movie star turned basic cable notable?	Thats right! Lets call his business manager and tell him to spend all his money on Yankees hats and Derek Jeter jerseys.
I dont know, Bart. What if Denis Leary gets mad?	Naw, hes cool. Hes gonna think this is hilarious.
Denis Leary, you little puke! Im gonna rip out your heart with two fingers! They taught me how to do it for my show!	Which one, the one that got canceled or the one thats gonna get canceled?
That laughter sounds like the result of misbehavior. Bart! How did you get a cell phone?	Same way you got me by accident, on a golf course.
Whose phone is this?	Youll never get it out of me.
Okay, here goes. Bart, I have something for you!	Wait a minute. I thought you said I couldnt have this.
Wait a minute. I thought you said I couldnt have this.	Awesome, another call.
Well, sweetie... I know I said you couldnt have a cell phone, but, in these days of stranger dangers and sinister ministers, I think its important that were in touch.	Lady, you are the best Mom ever!
You sure this is safe?	Sure, I got my seatbelt on.
What are you doing at this construction site?!	Uh, trying to do something constructive?
Uh, trying to do something constructive?	Ill just take Milhouse home.

Yeah. And I think they may be gone a while longer. Ooh, it looks like the grilled Twizzlers are ready.	Mmm, oh yeah, this baby is done.
Awesome. But I better get goin. Its gettin dark. My Moms gonna wake up soon. She gets upset if someones not there to tell her where she is. Typical mom.	You sure you dont wanna stay and have a sleepover? I made sleepover shirts.
Oh man... when youre alone, night is scary.	Day is awesome!
Day is awesome!	Night is scary.
Night is scary.	Day is awesome!
Day is awesome!	Night is scary...
Thank God youre okay!	Were you guys gone?
We were gone for two weeks!	I didnt even notice.
I just made a thirty-seven hundred mile car trip. I need to wash up.	Never leave again.
Stupid shopping list, turning food into work. Bart!	Look at me! Im doin something!
Hmmm, you make a good case. Ill take it!	Dad, look at me! Look at me!
Dad, look at me! Look at me!	Cannonball!
You just cost me two hundred thousand dollars!	I thought it was fifty.
Wheres Bart? Were gonna be late for Lennys party.	Dont waste your shot, Bart. Youve got just enough cat pee to soak two dorks.
Bart Simpson! Did you just spray water on me?!	Uh... it was water this morning.
Mom! Barts flicking boogers on me!	Theyre not boogers! Theyre clumps of rubber cement. That I stored in my nose.
No flicking boogers, and no driving into trees!	Yes, maam.
It was worth it so everyone could have a wonderful evening and go home with a gift bag.	A vacuuming robot!
Well, whoever did this must be long gone by now, Chief. I dont know how well ever catch him.	Kill, kill, kill!

Bart, Ive had it with you! Im taking away all your TV privileges.	You already did that.
Okay, then videogames.	That too.
No more non-dice board games.	What? You cant take my Balderdash!
I dont mean to be bad. I dont know why I do the things I do.	No one understands me. I wish I had a different family.
I feel exactly the same way.	Oh my God! You look like a dorky version of me!
And you look like a dimwitted version of me!	This is my bedroom?!
My names Simon Woosterfield.	Woosterfield? Your family owns this place! And Woosterfield Arena! Bonnie Raitt played there! You guys must be loaded!
Yes. But the funny thing about being rich is sometimes you wake up feeling--	Terrific? Incredible? Happy as a clown?
Wouldnt it be hilarious if we switched places and lived each others lives for a while?	Hm, I dont know. Im pretty attached to my family, and...
Get out here, boy! I wanna punish you before I get drunk and merciful!	Deal.
My butlers name is Chester. I have a brother named Devon and a sister named Quenly. Oh, and my horse is called Shadowfax. You cant miss him. Hes the only Lipizzaner in our stable.	Lipizzaner... got it.

Ooh, and a racecar bed...that really races!	Wow, a cool poster of Joe Montana!
Im the real deal. Every day I stand here the family donates a million dollars to Notre Dame. Did you know the words Notre Dame are French, but the team is the Fighting Irish? Thats the kind of thing I think about in here.	Back in the poster, gabby.
Yes, sir.	Milhouse, its me. Check out the caller I.D. on your phone.
Blocked Number? That service is three sixty-five a month! Did you switch places with a millionaire kid who looks just like you?	Just sit tight -- Im sending a car.
Well, well. If it isnt our half-wit half-brother.	Ow! The ol hot spoon. But why?
Because youre our half brother, youre blocking our full inheritance and we hate you.	Oh, now I get it.
Bart, I have a crush on your new sister.	You had a crush on my old sister.
This place is insane! Tonight, I got sent to bed without dinner!	Oh yeah? Well whats up with your brother and sister?
Theyre jealous because my father, left their mother, to be with my mother, to--	Eh, you lost me. Well, gotta go -- enjoy the upper-lower middle class!
My familys here!	Fancy party! This is like a rap video before the rappers show up.
All the Woosterfields will be buried here. Do you know that after a hundred years, dead bodies turn to red licorice?	Whoa! Let me at it!
Whoa! Let me at it!	Help! Let me out! I have my doubts about this licorice!
Help! Let me out! I have my doubts about this licorice!	Oh, Mr. Burns! Im really sorry!
You know, Master Simon, I too was once the youngest in a wealthy family.	You were once the youngest of something?
My older brother was trampled by a horse, my sister died of a poisoned potato, my twin was shot, that girl was stabbed, he ate another poisoned potato, spontaneous combustion, fell down a well, potato, potato, and impaled on the Chrysler Building.	Wow, only you survived which means the entire fortune went to you.
A word of caution, young Woosterfield watch out for those closest to you.	Devon and Quenly?
You dont know when theyll strike -- a boating accident, a mishap during a ski trip. But rest assured one way or another they will do you in.	Oh my God. Simon set me up. And all this time I thought he wanted the life of a stranger he met in the bathroom.
Come on, Bart, youve gotta get outta here. Pack like youve never packed before. You know, I have never packed before.	This is hard!
So, youre packing. You mustve already heard.	Heard what?
On a little ski trip.	Ski trip?
Ill be anything and everything you want! Dont leave me here with them!	I never thought Id say this, but I missed you guys. Even whats her name, Lisa.
How dare you expose my children to your tender feelings! Bart! Dont you dare take your eyes off that Gameboy!	Yes, sir.
Kids, this place has very special memories for your mother and me.	Well, leaving right now will become a special memory for me.
They have a pe-dal car.	Pedal cars su-uck!
We won, hes asleep!	And well stay up forever!
Why cant you just admit were lost?	Ill tell you whats lost your sense of adventure.
Excuse me, boys! My brother is lost, and kind of a jerk. If hed brought a map of the grounds as I suggested, then we would--	Lisa, do you know why I spend every day after school in detention? So I dont have to come home to you!
Oh, Bart. Dont say things you cant take back.	Its out there. Deal with it!
Oh great. Now you woke the baby.	I told you we should have left her with your mother!
My God, Bart, what happened to us?	We grew up.
Now we wait for the river to freeze. If my theory of global cooling is correct.	Hey, you guys want a lift in my pedal boat?
Its not a pedal boat. Its a pedal car that Bart drove into the river. Because he knows a shortcut thats not on the map.	Howd you like a shortcut to the bottom of the river?
If its your shortcut, Ill be high and dry.	Knock it off back there.
But were married.	Okay, but keep it PG.
How about R?	PG-13.
Ow.	Maybe we should put a dollar in the jar. Prime the pump.
Lemonade! We want lemonade!	Dont worry, folks. Our master chef is stirring up a fresh batch.
Um... I think its... we dont have one.	Thirty-five cents? Where did that come from? Cant be mine -- must be yours.
Have fun!	Ay Carumba!
Bart, Ive fallen in love with crosswords!	It finally happened -- youve gone completely fruit loops.
FRUIT LOOPS? Thats the answer to thirty-eight down toucans delight!	No, I mean youre loco in the coco!
COCOA! Ice rink drink!	Youre losin it!
LOSIN IT! RisquÃ© 80s teen flick!	Fine, go nuts -- see if I care!
EYE CARE! Opticians concern. Oh, thanks for your help, Bart! BART? San Francisco people mover!	Speaking of San Francisco people mover
Sure is.	Whos driving the bus?
Lets see, thats ENRICO FERMI, and there youve got the PET SHOP BOYS, and cross the T and zing the Z and skit skat skoodily Im all the way home.	Lisa got hustled!
Hey, those are fifteen month calendars! That gives you three extra kittens!	Thats the last time I get you guys a Christmas present at the last minute.
Thats the last time I get you guys a Christmas present at the last minute.	Man, those are ugly kittens.
And that announcement is...	Youre all losers!
Flay him with your earbuds! Flay him I say!	MyCube! Take me away!
Stupid angry mob... chasing me because I shine a harsh light on modern society. Now I know how Dane Cook feels.	Mmm, whats that exotic aroma? It smells like a hamburger cooked at a rug store.
Would you like some lamb?	Whoa. All these years Ive been petting lambs when I shouldve been shoving them in my mouth. Im Bart.
Im Bashir. My family and I just moved here, from Jordan.	Jordan. Thats on some map somewhere, right?
Bashir, introduce me to your new friend.	Bashir, you didnt tell me you had a sister.
Such a charmer. Would you like to stay for dinner?	Hey, I never refuse food from strangers.
Ah, thats not clever. And I have so many aspects you can mock! Im poor, Im dirty, I cant read nor write, I think movies are real...	Okay, next, heres the food at the cafeteria that will make you sick coleslaw, tuna, all chowders and gumbos. The only thing thats safe is the pork chops.
My religion says I can never eat pork.	A different religion? Do not tell anyone that, because if the bullies around here find out that youre different--
Im gonna punch you extra hard cause I secretly think youre cute.	Whoa, whoa, whoa! You cant just whale on him because hes... what religion are you anyway?
Muslim.	Hoo boy.
Ow!	Look guys, everyones different. Jimbo, youre Christian. Dolph, youre Jewish. And Kearney, your familys in that cult Moe started.
Milhouse is lookin good -- hes got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... Salaam alaikum!	Dad, thats Bashir -- my new friend.
Whats the matter? Dont like the taste of freedom?	Dad! These people are my friends! Dont fear them just because they have a different religion, a different culture, and their last name is Bin Laden!
Darling, I think youre working much too hard.	I cant believe your dad gets paid to blow stuff up.
Actually, Bart, my job is about math and engineering. Every calculation is to make sure the explosion is safe.	Did you factor in one bald idiot?
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!	Dad, it was an empty building. It was supposed to come down!
Lisa, add another name to our Christmas card list. Next to our Jewish friends. Where is Lisa?	She said something about the bottom of the ocean and be back in a month.
Nice prank, Simpson. I dare you to dump that bees nest on those second-grade babies.	Why would I want to?
The point is, Simpson, a dare has been placed on your nards.	My nards accept!
Dare annulled.	Can I appeal?
Its not for long. But until they find a suitable habitat, this beard is the only hope for these bees.	Relax, Mom. Ill mold them into a shape you know and love.
Theyre just drones, Lisa. They only live for like five minutes anyway. And they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and Bart.	Yeah!
Namaste.	Pardon me, master, but what does a big fat wad like you know about kung fu?
I need some candy for a first playdate, but I dont want to come on too strong.	M&Ms?
Well... if I pick plain shell think Im cheap, but if I pick peanut, she may have an allergy. You just killed her, Bart!	How about Charleston Chew?
What is this, Brooklyn in the fifties? Dont just say stuff.	You ask for my help, then you dont want it.
Finally, a real suggestion!	If she doesnt like coconut, youre screwed!
...So Lisa asked if her new friend could stay for dinner! Shes finally doing something the book said she would!	Wont last.
Are your parents okay with that? Theyve never met us.	We could be murderers.
We... I... You come up with an excuse!	Ow.
Bart Simpson, age three.	Bart Simpson, age ten.
Lisa ran away, and its all my fault! If Id just let her continue her obsessive relationship with that troubled little girl, everything wouldve been fine.	If I know my sister, and unfortunately I do, she probably ran off to some lame-o make-believe castle.
...unfortunately, it is not what were looking for at this time. Thank you for thinking of us.	Re-jected!
Okay, chapter one... uh... uh... writing is hard.	Ladies and gentlemen Fallout boy!
Youre better than us!	Homer, that guys your age?
The guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like hes God. Well, God doesnt need his own special day!	What about Sunday?
Guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.	He looks happy.
Yes! I want him to know that if your life doesnt turn out the way you want, theres someone else to blame.	I already knew that, Dad. Im gonna blame you.
I respect your choice. Now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a Tom Collins.	With a virgin Tom Collins for me?
Homie, youre barely eating.	Yeah, I can actually see your hands. Theyre not just a blur.
Can you keep her quiet?	Not even when shes snorkeling.
Uh, yes. That must be it. This is the best of all possible worlds. Blah, blah, blah.	Slurp my snot.
Just stop.	Dad, we think the sauce had it all wrong.
Hey, was there another plaque here before?	Plaques come, plaques go.
God no!	I hear theres a Korean barbeque place where the beef spells out the date of your death.
...of school!	What are you doing?
Free at last! Free at last!	I cant believe we have to start another year of school. I never learned anything at that suck shack.
Who taught you that language?!	Kid at school.
Withdrawn.	I wrote Slurp My Snot in the ovals on the answer sheet. True story.
Nine-hundred and twelve divided by six!	You cant teach this way!
So, when you take your practice test, take your number two pencil and...	What kind of pencil do we take again?
Bart, you and the other perfect-scoring Superstars are exempt from taking the actual test today.	No test?
Now dont be too disappointed. We are throwing you a pizza party at a bowling alley.	Well, its about time.
Barts here! / Awesome!	Wait a minute. This aint no genius copter. This is con air!
Heli-copter! Heli-copter!	Stop it! All of you!
Whats the matter, superstar? Feeling sorry for the normals?	Dont you get it? There is no pizza party. This isnt a helicopter.
Let me explain this to you in terms even the simplest will understand. Were hiding you in Capital City for the day so your numb-skullery wont drag down the test scores of the children who are our future.	Told ya.
Lets all act stupid!	Doy. Doy. Doy. Doy.
All right, stay calm, boys. Oh God! Were at the corner of Cesar Chavez Way and Martin Luther King Boulevard!	Ay carumba.
My name isnt Skinrash, its Principal Skinner, and you will address me as such.	Sure thing, Such.
Bart, do you have your slingshot?	No, sir.
I see it in your back pocket.	Just dont stretch it out.
Boy, where are my zydeco records?	Theres twelve more boxes. And they all sound the same!
I know they do, but the Simpson Mardi Gras party has been a tradition since two days before you were born. And we spare no expense.	What about my birthday party?
This is so hard because I always thought Mom was the strong one.	She is. Look.
Okay, everyone squeeze in.	Evil triumphs again.
Evil triumphs again.	Ow!
Poltergeist in the closet...	I died when Homer sat on me!
Dad, weve been trapped in the house for days. Cant we play outside?	Yeah, without the sun, my hairs reverting to its natural red.
Yeah, without the sun, my hairs reverting to its natural red.	I dont want to be called Rusty again! I dont!
You know, it says here that Grampa has to remain in the house, but we dont. How about a family outing?	Family outing? Ill start -- Lisas gay!
So, after I paid for the ice cream cones, I said thank you and was on my way.	We know, Dad. We were there.
Theres a lesson here life is fickle. You should appreciate every... stop kicking, Bart!	But kicking is the only toy I have.
Okay, people, weve hit penumbra. Brace yourself for umbra.	Im gonna see it first!
No, Im gonna see it first!	Hit the road, ya big load!
Kids, I have to tell your Mom I lost Maggie.	But Dr. Hibbert said not to stress her out.
Step aside, ladies -- Im bringin the peace!	I am so staying up past my bedtime.
The Sprinkle King, Sprinkle Queen, and Deluxe Sprinkle King are the Simon and Garfunkel plus one of hose-nozzle dispersal arrays. Observe.	Classic hose-play.
Please, can I get it, Marge? Please? Please?	I can have all my birthday parties in it!
Well, yes.	Come on, man. Baptize your buns!
Hm. There was a note on the fridge marked urgent. Funny word urgent. Urrrgent. Urgent.	One of us should go look at it.
Hmm. Probably a reminder to relax more.	Oh yeah. / Thats it.
Well, Ireland is at the forefront of Europes tech boom.	In your face, Belgium!
Bart, if you hate Belgium so much, maybe I should take your Tintins away!	No, Ill be good!
Gimme a beer and a shot of whiskey!	Ill have one drink, one cocktail and one booze, please.
While your father and your grandfather have a drink were going to see sights.	Hey, I just spent ten hours on a plane. Im stayin here. Theyve got German Krusty on TV!
Ja ja! Krusty spritzen der gas wasser!	Such a beautiful language.
They say if you kiss the Blarney Stone, you get the gift of gab. Which is great, but Im not sure I like the idea of getting a gift in return for kissing. What kind of a message is that for Lisa and Maggie? Those are my daughters. But on the other hand, America doesnt have any stones worth kissing -- except for Stone Phillips. Do you have one of him here? If so, hes our your him.	K-I/S-S-M-Y/A-S-S spells kiss my ass!
K-I/S-S-M-Y/A-S-S spells kiss my ass!	Fresh!
Every June sixteenth, lovers of James Joyce follow the route traveled by Leopold Bloom in the novel Ulysses.	Hm, let me make a note of that.
Hm, let me make a note of that.	What youre saying is weve run out of fun things to do.
I need that paper quick!	So you and Mom arent married? Does that mean Im a bastard?
I think its romantic. You can pretend youre newlyweds starting a life together.	Yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock.
Fine. Well do it your way.	This ones a little gay, isnt it?
I dont understand. Dad would never miss an open bar with chicken wings. Plus he loves Mom, and us, yada, yada, yada.	Hey, I found something!
He ruined the wedding -- getting his revenge on us at last!	Because he knows that if Mom and Dad dont get married, Ill never be born!
Oh, dont worry. Nothings gonna happen to you, Mr. Teeny Number Seven.	Bob, did you take any breaks yesterday... to kidnap our dad?
And this game is over! Unbelievable! Youll never see anything like that again!	What she means is, well eat your cookies later. If you dont want us to tell our Mom what you did, youre gonna have to pay.
Pay? Pay for what?	Ask her, shes the brains. Im the thing thats not brains.
Come on, Maggie. Have some grapefruit.	She seems upset. Maybe if I lay down a beat on my bongos, thatll soothe her.
Check. Did you unscrew all the flat heads?	Yep. And now we wait.
You said tech stocks were bulletproof!	Look, I gotta go. But dont worry, Ill visit you every day. I promise.
Its her! The little girl who doesnt recoil at the sight of us.	Huh?
With this cookie I can buy back Private OMalley from the Zulus.	I think it is so cool what you are doing. So whats the gag? You put ex-lax in the cookies, then just sit back and watch the fireworks?
I would never do that!	Oh, right. Um, I was thinking of other things that are hilarious. Like... things that you think are funny.
Yeah, those are funny.	Yeah. Im Bart.
Im Jenny.	Oh my God, how long was I zoned out?
So, whos the special someone?	Jenny. Fifth grade girl.
Whoa, she gets to use the real scissors. Nice.	When she talks to me, I feel like a better person.
Take two. You might get lucky.	Hey, Jenny.
Hi, Bart.	Boy, you make it look effortless. And that kids giving you zero pump.
Punch herrrr!	Hey, do you want to go on a picnic tomorrow? Youd love my P.B. and J. The secret is, no P.B., double J.
Its a date!	Yes!!! Willie, Ive got a girlfriend!
Really? Well, eh, I do too. Shes... a bikini model from Sweden.	Hey, thats great.
So, you visit old folks. How else do you make the world a better place?	Uh... I...
Uh... I...	I spend a lot of time working with this mentally-challenged guy. Why, here he is now. Lookin good, Homer!
Boy.	Just wait.
Look, man, I dont want any trouble. Cmon -- here, here, just take my wallet. Leave me alone, okay?	Do you know who else was really into rowboats? Jesus. And he couldve turned his rowboat into a jet ski, but he didnt. Good guy.
Bart! Cant you do something?	Those bullies are gonna kill me! Why am I doing this?
Those bullies are gonna kill me! Why am I doing this?	Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.	Please, guys, give me a break. Can you give me the duckling without beating me up?
Well... well have to beat you up a little.	Cmon, Im trying to impress a girl.
Oh, go ahead -- numb me.	Mom, can I get those dishes for you?
Whats your angle, Mister?	No angle.
No angle.	Um, if this girl Im seeing comes here, and she might, I wouldnt mind if you told her I was the kind of boy that does the dishes.
You never told me that the special man you were working with is your father.	Uh... its not an easy thing to admit.
Is the rest of your family... okay?	Uh... well...
And nothing can ever change my opinion about him.	We dont have any money! Go away! May I de-corn your cob, my darling?
Why didnt you come to visit me, Bart?	Yeah, I meant to, Ive just been sooo busy. My schedule has been all like .
Bart? Would you be interested in swears?	Yes, because only by knowing them can you prevent bad little kids from saying them.
Yes, because only by knowing them can you prevent bad little kids from saying them.	What do you want from me?!
I want to know why my best friend didnt visit me like he said he would.	Milhouse, real best friends often dont speak for years at a time. Like John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.
Just because you saw one episode of one mini-series doesnt mean you get to use it as a whip!	Look, man. I have to keep my dark past hidden. Theres someone new in my life now.
Oh, I get it. Its love. I guess you found your Abigail Adams.	My who?
I knew it.	Sorry Im late. I didnt realize you had to turn the oven on to bake stuff.
Mine too! Bart, we should take Milhouse on our trip to juice country.	Are you nuts?! Milhouse will spill everything. By which I mean juice, not secrets!
Milhouse is funny. The way hes always shaking me by the shoulders and saying I dont know the real you. Funny!	Im tired of talking about Milhouse!
Hello, Bart. Surprised to see me at sea level? Well, you cant bleed out your nose when your hearts broken.	Milhouse, could you stop being creepy for just a minute?
Jenny, I cant take the pressure anymore. I have to come clean. Im only pretending to be good...	Before I met you, I was El Barto, Skinners Bane, the Sultan of Spitwads, the Dean of D-minus, the Ay carumba Kid!
No, no, no, no, no!	But now Im good because you turned me good. Isnt that all that matters?
Are you saying our entire relationship is based on lies?	Not our entire relationship. Just the stuff I said.
Bart, in my concurrent adventure, I learned a really important lesson you cant wallow in despair. Face things as they really are.	Youre right. Ive gotta straighten this out.
Youre right. Ive gotta straighten this out.	How much for these roses, Apu?
Oh, Bart! I was born forgiving you.	Youve always been there for me, man. Ill never turn my back on you again.
Punch him! Punch him! Punch hiiim!	Milhouse, whaddaya say to a make-up prank?
Skin-ner!	Cue music.
Cue music.	And, cue snow.
Shoot an oversized basketball into an undersized hoop! Its impossible! The prizes have been here for fifty years!	Maybe we should just check out the street performers.
Dad, no!	Dad, yes!
Dont have one.	Dad, what are you doing here?
Son, from now on, Im eating all my meals here at school -- with you!	What? No!
Buddy, Im here to eat, not make interesting conversation.	Dad, do you have to hang out at my school? Its bad enough I have to be here three days a week!
Well, I know when Im not wanted. Am I wanted?	No.
Look at all these helicopter parents. I hope Barts doing okay on his own.	La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
Bart Simpson, what will you be making?	Iunno.
Hey boy, why dont I do that for you?	Isnt this supposed to be my project?
All the other parents are doing it for their kids. Now stand back and Ill take it from here. A little further back.	Do you want me to watch and learn?
Yes! Yes! In your face, losers! This helicopter is taking off!	No! Stop the hovering!
Ooh! Thats Barts class.	Lousy teachers.
As you know, the music of Air Supply is timeless. And now their fifty biggest hits are on four CDs...	Wait, wait, wait. Youre putting us in a new school?! What about my friends?
Field trips to Europe!	Oh my God, look what they serve in the cafeteria!
Okay, I held up my side of the bargain. Now you have to go to Ralphies birthday party.	A deals a deal.
And youll stay till we cut the cake.	Fine. I want one gift bag now, and one when the partys over.
Oh my! Thats a bit rough.	Now to turn my sis from loser to schmoozer.
What do you want from us, bad boy?	Dont tell anyone, but my sister Lisa is best friends with Alaska Nebraska.
Bart! Your plan worked!	My plan was to lie. Lie like hell. And thats what I did.
Mom! Dad! I have to leave Waverly Hills and never come back!	Ive gotta get back, too! I just remembered I was playing hide and seek with Milhouse.
Cmon, boy! Be cool!	But...
Customers! How I hate them.	Excuse me, I just heard that before Spider-Man was a movie it was a comic book. Is that possible?
Suffering Steve Ditko! How can you not know that Spider-Man first appeared in 1962s classic Amazing Fantasy Number Fifteen.	Ooh, twelve cents. Ill take eight!
Hulk smash! Hulk smash! Hulk smash!	Huh. Whats this?
Everyman? Hes not a hero from Marvel, D.C., Image or WildStorm.	It was a typical day for delivery man Avery Mann. Until...
Put my comic down.	You made this?
Shut up! No one is interested in the critical judgment of a worthless child...	Actually, I like it.
Everyman is awesome! Reading it I escaped from my troubles! Now theyre back in spades.	Have you shown this to anyone?
No. If copies got out, it would be ridiculed by the online community -- SonofSonofSpock, TheDorkKnight, and IkilledKenny6475.	Dont be afraid of them. Theyre just Lame-os like yourself.
Eh, they can go to Hell. Bart?	Dr. Hibbert found out my thyroid isnt pumping out enough--
Whatd you think, kids?	That was awesome!
How could Krabappel take my cell phone? Im only on month one of a sixty-month plan!	You know, Krabappel just needs to chill out and realize life is cool. But how?
Hmm... You know, my dad is a lot more fun after a few beers.	Maybe Mrs. K would be nicer if we Irish up her coffee.
No.	No, booze. First the easy part kids, get some liquor.
What if she tastes the booze?	Relax. Hazelnut creamer covers all sins.
THIS OLD MAN, HE PLAYED ONE! HE PLAYED NICK-KNACK ON MY... THUMB!	You look tired. Maybe you need some more coffee.
Edna, lets go.	Uh-oh. Do you think we went too far?
Yes, you have. What are these?	All thanks to... The Answer!
Theres a form to extend your health insurance on my desk.	I never wanted her to get fired.
I bet it was that hamster medicine we added that put her over the edge.	Maybe I should tell Skinner that it was our...
But why talk when I could text?	Our cell phones!
I thought you were studying the Lincoln-Douglas debates?	You mean the L-man-D-dog flame wars?
Im glad youve got such a stimulating substitute, but Im worried about Mrs. Krabappel.	Oh, no worries. I heard on the four-square court shes doin great.
Anybody want to return these caveman kudos to Mrs. Krabappel?	Oh sure... its sorta on my way home. I can check up on the old girl. She probably landed a job at some fancy-schmancy prep school.
Doors broken!	Mrs. K? Is everything all right?
Thanks for bringing over the smiley stickers, Bart. They really livened the place up.	Mrs. K., youve gotta get outta here. When was the last time you washed your hair?
Hmm... Two weeks ago?	Well, thats better than me. But still, youve gotta get out.
Two hot chocolates. With hot fudge boost.	Milhouse... we ruined Ednas life. Maybe we can get her job back.
Check out the multiples of seven yall.	Theres got to be some other way to help Mrs. K.
Maybe we can find an answer in this bookstore.	Bookstores dont have answers. They just have creepy guys sitting in easy chairs at the end of aisleways.
Excuse me. I believe you boys are looking for... The Answer.	Whats The Answer?
Bart, youre a good kid. Youre the only one who came to see me.	Well, Mrs. K. I have just the book slash DVD for you. The Answer.
Well, Mrs. K. I have just the book slash DVD for you. The Answer.	This book uses the ancient power of wanting.
That makes absolutely no sense.	Hey... Just because we dont understand electricity, doesnt mean we cant enjoy its benefits.
But we do understand electricity. Every positively charged nucleus is--	Cut it out. Youre not a teacher anymore.
Way to cheer me up, kid.	Look, Mrs. K, Im a Simpson. And a Simpson never gives up until hes tried at least one easy thing. Let me help you.
Yes. But it still seems stupid.	I want to own a muffin store. Great idea! Now lets see...
I want to own a muffin store. Great idea! Now lets see...	Break your dream down into smaller wishes, then break those down into wish-able actions.
Bart, this is starting to sound like one of those loony self-help books.	Loony? Would a loony self-help book come with a magic question mark inside?
Loony? Would a loony self-help book come with a magic question mark inside?	Eh? Eh? Eh?
Well, opening this store was a lot of work. But your faith in me got me through it. And it looks like youve got your own index card of fate. Whats your dream?	Nothing, nothing.
One cran-bran for the Flan-man.	My pleasure.
What did he want?	Beats me, I just gave him a banana.
Well, thanks again, Bart -- this store has definitely turned my life around.	Yep. Im off the hook now.
What do you mean by that?	Well, I guess I can tell you... cause everything worked out for the best...
Everything? What everything?	Well, its funny, really. Im the one who put booze in your coffee and got you fired.
You did what?!	Please dont kill me.
You ruined my life! Its your fault I have to work at this stupid muffin store.	But this place was your dream!
My real dream was to be a teacher -- and you got me fired! Now Im up to my eyeballs in debt with this stupid store, and four more muffin stores just opened on this block!	Noooo!
Noooo!	But-but-but, you found The Answer!
But-but-but, you found The Answer!	Nooo! I wrote a phone number in there!
No... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.	But you think theres like a kernel of good inside me, right?
Hm, I dont know -- kernels are kind of big.	Listen... I was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?
When you say teacher, do you really mean parent?	No, I mean teacher.
Great. Go nuts. But remember, we never had this discussion.	What discussion?
Bart, you deserve a reward for telling the truth, and that reward will be in the form of a severe punishment.	Doesnt matter, as long as Edna gets her job back.
Bart, you said you didnt get him drunk.	I didnt. I swear!
Well, class, Ive gotta say Im glad to be back.	And theres no hard feelings?
Nope. Now, everyone enjoy one of my yummy muffins.	But its stale.
Not everyone has a deathbed, son -- you could die suddenly.	Whoa. Maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang.
Ask him.	Sir, could you sign my program with a swear word?
Bart, let him go!	But Mom, Im winning! Look at this! His lunch money!
God didnt give you legs so you could use them as scissors!	I was just doing the moves I learned from Ultimate Punching!
Mom, dont do this! This sport is as fun for me as having kids is for you!	Tell her, Dad! You love Ultimate Punching even more than I do!
Ultimate Punching is exploitative, violent and a bad influence on our young people. Studies have shown your mother is right.	What the?
What the?	Chocolate, whipped cream... cherries! She got to you! With a piece of black forest cake!
It wasnt just a piece -- it was the whole cake! Frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a Bavarian castle!	Glad you didnt come cheap.
Whatd I miss?	Nothin.
How can I control her?! I have nothing to withhold!	Oh man, now shes writing cutesy things with the ribbon.
Marge, I tried my best to talk you out of this. But since youre going through with it, I beg you, just stay out of his way and dont get hurt.	And Mom, if you punch him in the junk, youll get no disrespect from me.
Id just like to say one thing. I only agreed to this fight because I wanted to stop the violence. And sure I got into great shape and met some fun people, but I ended up discovering my own dark side. So from now on, the only thing Im fighting is this cold Im coming down with.	Mom, thats a beautiful thought.
No holds barred.	Hey, Lis.
Yeah?	I dont know when well be in a septagon again. Wanna settle this bad blood thats been going on between us since you were born?
Stupid Miss Hoover.	I heard about your run-in with Hoover. Arent teachers the worst?
I dont want to talk about it.	Listen, youre a smart kid. I bet you like ideas.
I do.	Well, I just had a whopper! What if you got revenge on Krabappel for me, and I got revenge on Hoover for you? Crisscross!
Interesting. With no obvious motive, no one would suspect us.	Exactly. Crisscross! Do we have a deal?
Thanks... but Ill pass.	If I say crisscross one more time, will that change your mind?
Listen, youre a persistent fellow, but I--	Crisscross!
Bart, have you established your alibi?	Yep. Im at the tennis match.
And people will remember you were there?	Im pretty sure they will.
You shouldve seen the look on Krabappels face!	And you shouldve seen the look on Hoovers face. In fact, here it is.
You killed her?	Right. Like we agreed.
I never said kill!	Yeah, cause youre smart. You dont say kill, you say prank. Like Mom and Dad say snuggle when what they really mean is lets lock the door and hug.
Yeah, ding-dong-ditch!	Ding-dong-ditch means you kill her, then you throw that ding-dong into a ditch. Geez, pick up a book.
Youre a monster!	A deals a deal, little sister. Tomorrow after school, go to her house and t.p. her.
Thats it? Just t.p. her?	Yeah, torture and pulverize her. Then ding-dong-ditch the body and were even.
Come on! I trust you completely!	Slice her like a bagel!
Bart?!	Ive been waiting for you -- and trying to figure out how girls pee.
What if I gave you homework help? I wont give you the answers, but Ill give you the tools to find the answers yourself.	No dice -- either take care of Krabappel, or Groundskeeper Willie will say he saw you kill Miss Hoover.
Why would Willie do that?	Lets just say... he owes me a favor.
Crisscross! Like the plaid on me kilt!	Youre not wearin a kilt.
/ Ice cream! /	Go ahead, do it. Youre no different from me. Were made from the same dinna.
I cant make sense of that muncher talk!	Hungry. So hungry. Theres nothing to eat. Except this.
Hungry. So hungry. Theres nothing to eat. Except this.	Theres gotta be something yummy out there.
Yes, and-- Oh, go ahead.	Wait! The burger didnt change me! Im not a muncher!
I dont see the safe zone anywhere.	Lets play a game who gets to carry the chosen one?
Lets play a game who gets to carry the chosen one?	Ow!
Oh, did the chosen one hurt his chosen little noggin?	Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Quit it. Ow! Quit it.
I think the better brains is, are you brains a brains?	Where do you want it, the mouth or the eyes?
Ooo, mouth.	Eyes it is.
And all we had to do was let Bart take a bath in our food.	Hey, Lis. Want some soup?
Id give Barts Mom a General wow!	Knock it off! Thats my Mom youre talkin about.
Mrs. S., you can tuck me in any time...	Okay, buddy. Lower the eyebrows. Nice and easy.
Id like to get quizzical with Barts Mom!	Shut up!
Sorry -- I have a tea party at Janeys.	And Im having a stink bomb party at the house next to Janeys. No connection.
Oh, Im sorry, kids. We lost the batteries for that.	No problem. A couple just rolled out from behind your seat.
Oh, darn, the batteries are dead.	Not to worry. It plugs into this cigarette lighter.
Im thinking of joining.	No, no, no. Youre too young to be a witch. Savor the steps leading up to it college anorexic, string of bad marriages, career disappointments, failed pottery shop. And then when youre old and alone, you can hit the witch thing hard.
Theyre not evil! They believe in friendship and respecting the earth... and they made me feel like I belonged.	Your honor, Id like to enter something into the record.
Strangely, Ill allow it.	Ladies and gentlemen, I am a big dummy with a stupid job. I write down what other people say just like a big dummy would. Could the court reporter read that back?
Oh look how the snow glistens on the tiniest branches!	Yeah, yeah, miracles are all around us. Now please, I am trying to hear the school closings.
...ba Diving Academy.	Oh, for cryin out loud!
Snow day!	What the?
What a smart way to spend a snowy day.	Good grief.
Good grief.	Headshot! / Headshot! / Ooh, right in the carrot! / Headshot!
Headshot! / Headshot! / Ooh, right in the carrot! / Headshot!	Huh?
A branch mustve knocked out the power lines.	Fine. Ill see whats on TV.
That runs on electricity also.	All right, Ill watch a DVD.
All right, Ill watch a DVD.	Theres no way that runs on electricity.
What do you want?	I... wanna play with you guys.
Belt is by Twizzler, vest courtesy of Nelson, tights are by Hello Kitty...	Hello Kitty? I thought they were Spider-Man heads! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Well be closer than best friends for the rest of our lives. But youll never know what thats like, because you wont ever have a brother.	I dont need a brother. Im a badass loner like Wolverine, who leaves whenever people beg him not to leave.
/ BOIL-BOIL-BOIL-BOIL-BOIL / DOOO-OWN!	Oh my God, I want a brother!
Son, I love you kids. But Im only going to the hospital one more time in my life and I aint comin out.	Lisa got a sister! Why cant you have another boy?
Girls are easy girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls dont steal my knives...and I dont have to tell girls how their bodies work, cause I dont know.	You never told me how my body works.
Maybe you could trick your parents into making a baby. The way my Mom nearly tricked Charles Barkley.	Trick em, I like it. But how?
Hope you saved room for passion fruit soufflÃ© with crÃ¨me anglais for two.	And one for mom.
Hey, this is the DVD my parents used to make me.	So it kinda works...
Nice loog! / Wish Id hocked that!	Look, I want a baby brother, but I cant get my parents to do it.
What youve got to worry about is the pill.	The pill? Whats that?
Its medicine doctors give moms to keep babies up in Heaven.	Well, I need a baby now and Im not getting any younger!
Then get rid of the pills.	Got it. How can I thank you?
Uh... give yourself a wedgie.	Dont you wanna do it?
Bart, youve always been a handful, but youve never interfered with my reproductive freedom. Why now?	I just wanted a baby brother, but Dad said I was one Uday who didnt need a Qusay. I just wanted what Lisa and Maggie have.
Holy moly!	What about what I want? Id help you take care of him.
Remember those hamsters you were going to take care of?	Oh my God, the hamsters!
And even if we did have another baby, it might not be a boy. It might be another sister.	Another sister!
Hey, you didnt see what I cooked up in the galley of my last flight to London. They dont call it Virgin Airlines anymore.	Youre right -- I cant risk another girl. Use whatever birth control you want. Its your body.
A ten-year-old cant adopt a child.	Oh, you think hes for me! You know, the orphan is for my folks -- they cant have more kids. It is so sad -- a real-life Jaws bit off my dads wiener.
Im sorry, kid. Its not gonna happen.	Id give my brother everything I have! He could be the race car in Monopoly! Monopoly! The race car!
Wake up!	Im Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Im your new brother!	Are you from the orphanage, or do I really not understand how babies are born?
Are you from the orphanage, or do I really not understand how babies are born?	So, Charlie, how did you escape the island of misfit boys?
Shopping its the most fun you can have standing up.	You like to shinny? I like to shinny. Where do you see yourself in twenty years?
One-armed drummer in a prison rock band.	Nice! Favorite Beatle?
Dung.	Me too!
Me too!	There must be some reason no one ever adopted you. Is one of your feet a hand?
People only want to adopt babies.	Babies? Weve got one of those. Overrated.
Babies? Weve got one of those. Overrated.	Shop it somewhere else, sister.
Hello, Sir.	Youre gonna be seeing a lot of him around the house.
Brother? What are you talkin about? How come Ive never seen him before?	Uh, he was born with two noses and we hid him away till we could afford to cut one off.
Two brothers? Bart, who is this kid?	Be cool, be cool -- hes an orphan. You know, just like Annie, except hes a dude and he hates tomorrow.
Bart, you have to take him back!	Youre just jealous cause now Ive got what youve got with Maggie, only better because were dudes with tudes!
Awesome -- they made a sequel to Sever Four! This movies gonna be great! Full of blood and gore and torture and guts and...	Two kids tickets for The Diversity Kittens.
Two kids tickets for The Diversity Kittens.	...and murder and swears and brains and basements...
Now you probably think Sever Five is a rip-off of Sever Four, but its actually based on the rich history of Hong Kong torture films.	Uh-oh.
The boogeymans gonna eat my brain!	Im sorry. I guess having a little brother is more responsibility than I thought. Especially cause I thought itd be no responsibility at all.
Its the boogeyman!	Theres no such thing as a boogeyman!
That mean boy took me to a scary movie. And he covered his sisters doll in peanut butter and bird seed.	Charlie, youd rat on me?
Awesome fake-out!	Sorry dude, I didnt see you.
Where are we gonna hide?	Iunno.
Iunno.	The same place Eskimos hide from penguins.
Hello, Bart.	How did you find us?
You left a trail of lost winter clothes.	Are you gonna turn us in?
No, Im gonna convince you to turn yourselves in.	Never!
Never, huh? What are you gonna eat?	Snow. Gods cotton candy.
Snow. Gods cotton candy.	Snow!
Oh no! You took too long to make an obvious decision!	Dont worry. Me and Charlie have one thing youll never have.
Dont worry. Me and Charlie have one thing youll never have.	Point and shoot, bro. Point and shoot.
Oh, gross, gross, gross, gross.	Hey, youre alive, arent you?
I want him first! / No, me! /	Not that stupid stuffed lamb again. This isnt learning!
Do you want to learn?	No, no, no. Im just sayin...
O cruel irony!	Hey, the only thing I bring home are notes to my parents, and those do not arrive the way that they left.
If youre not gonna take care of him right, then give him to me.	How come you dont get mad when I torment real animals?
I do! It enrages me!	I thought you Hindus were supposed to love everybody.
Hes in here. Safe and sound. Let me just staple that bag for you.	This isnt Larry. Its just cotton balls on toilet paper rolls! Wheres the real Larry?
What do you care? You dont even like him.	Of course I dont, but other people do!
Whered you get this rope?	Swiped it from gym class.
Bart, Im losing my grip!	Put the rope in your teeth!
What will that do?	Itll shut you up!
Itll shut you up!	Larry? Larry the Lamb?
Larry? Larry the Lamb?	There you are, you piece of crap.
Well, if you miss him, yell into a toilet.	Its dark down here.
Hey, Slimu!	Yeah, you better run!
Yeah, you better run!	Sewer cats!
Sewer cats!	Larry!
Larry!	Larry, you saved my life! Youre the most wonderful stuffed lamb in the world! Im sorry about the mean things I said. Well have the rest of the weekend to--
Aw cmon, Marge. Theres nothing funnier than a good ol bonk on the head.	I concur.
And I even got rainbow sprinkles!	Some rainbow -- theres no violet.
Then dont have any.	Hey, dont listen to me! What do I know about rainbows?!
CAUSE IN HER HEART A PRINCESS KNOWS / SHES THE ONLY GIRL WHO MATTERS!	I cant keep watching this dreck.
I cant keep watching this dreck.	Much better.
I agree its clichÃ©, but she does have a certain-- Unicorn!	That is so fake. You can see the strap on the horn!
You said it, Bart! Way to sum up the situation!	Take it easy, little buddy.
Do you want to come in and get your sister with me?	Hell no.
Watch your language! Now, why the hell not?	The Krusty Show sucks now. Its all pink and princessy. Why are great things always ruined by women? The Army... the Fantastic Four... think how awesome American Idol would be with just Simon and Randy!
What the--	Wheres all your Krusty stuff?
Aye carumba!	Krusty?
Im a Star Wars!	Snap out of it! Youre Krusty the clown! One of Look Magazines hundred most-promising clowns of nineteen fifty-eight!
A lot of suicides in that group... funny suicides but still. My day is over, kid.	What are you talking about? Whose name is on that sign?
Stop the music!	Thank God.
Im sick and tired of this woman...not being married to me!	Huh?
Oh, Krusty! Yes! Yes!	Thats it -- game over.
Is it, Bart? Is it?	What are you talking about?
A wedding is a complex thing, Bart -- its so easy for something to go wrong.	Milhouse Van Houten...will you do me the honor of ruining Krustys wedding with me?
Please dont leave me!	I dont care!
Youre not my ring bearer! What happened to the monkey?	I locked him in the torah room.
Kid, whats your angle? Im trying to seal the deal over here.	Princess, before you marry Krusty, theres someone you should meet...
Princess, before you marry Krusty, theres someone you should meet...	Holly Hippie. Krustys sidekick in 1969 and his first wife.
I was jealous of Neil Armstrong!	And his last wife, Eartha Kitt, recorded this before her untimely death.
You guys will be the hit of cousin Valeries wedding reception!	Can I just ask, who the hell says potato?
Start the joke!	Um, knock-knock?
Whos there?	Iunno.
Did I hear lettuce?	Not from me, you didnt.
Lettuce who?	I dont know!
Oops -- the Frisbee went into the bushes. Why dont you go find it?	You threw it, you go find it.
Why you little...	Ow! Theres a big box in here!
You go rent us a truck.	Ow!
Hm. Not as much money as there used to be.	Homer?
Lenny... and Carl... A fortune cookie... I ran into the candy machine... and I found an Emerson, Lake, and Palmer...	Okay, let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah, legitimately, but youre too scared to do anything fun with it?
Son, if I was interested in fun, I wouldve run away the day you were born.	Look man, youve got to enjoy yourself a little. You work hard, or at least youre out of the house a lot.
Youre right. I have been acting like Telethon Jerry Lewis when I shouldve been acting like rest-of-the-year Jerry Lewis. Will you teach me how to put myself first?	And how.
Wait!	I have to go to the bathroom!
Folks, its time for our final run.	No way! I wanna go a million more times!
Sorry boy. You have school tomorrow.	Rich kids dont need school! When I grow up, you can buy an apartment building and make me the super.
Boy, I am through spoiling you. First thing tomorrow youre going back to the rotten life youve always enjoyed.	Oh yeah? If you dont keep splashing the cash, Im gonna tell Mom that its thanks to you she made the first bad wedding toast ever.
Up -- thats my chair, boy.	No problem. Ill just sit here, closer to Moms ear. Mom, how do you think we really got that Panini Press?
I thought the government sent it to us as part of the stimulus package. At least thats what the letter said.	Well actually, Mom--
So Bart, hows your big school presentation coming along?	Oh great, now that Dads gonna star in it.
I agreed to no such thing!	Mo-om...
Where and what time?	Homeroom, eight a.m.
Never!	Mo-om...
Very good, Bart.	Can I get extra credit for a caveman break dance?
Fine. Let me just get my harness pads.	No time.
Boy, this has gone too far -- I quit! As soon as I finish these oats.	Hey, hey, hey. Lets not get crazy. If you quit, Im telling Mom everything.
Not if I tell her first.	Now how am I supposed to get to soccer practice?
Now how am I supposed to get to soccer practice?	Hey Milhouse, want a turn pulling my rickshaw?
Okay kids, time to apply the final date night touch. Lisa, spray just a hint of perfume on my neck, Bart, you tell me this dress doesnt make me look fat. And... now!	You dont look fat.
Exciting, exciting. I just have one question is curling a real thing?	Are you sure youre okay?
Yeah. Or is it just a cover story for a grownup thing were not allowed to know about?	Yeah, like the time you said Dad was taking a weekend leadership seminar, when he was really stuck in a barrel at the junkyard?
I saw you grooving to the beat! You gotta pay for that!	Lis, whats going on? Youre not normally this interesting.
Im fine! Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine...	Whats that noise?
Whats that noise?	Your dress is covered with pins.
What is this, tough love?	Eh, its a little more like soft hate.
Eh, its a little more like soft hate.	I said, all of them.
I said, all of them.	And now just put your pearls back on and well go get some coffee.
Nothin you got, Junior.	Really? Not even this first-ever pin from the twenty-fourteen Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia?
Really? Not even this first-ever pin from the twenty-fourteen Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia?	His name is Fatov. He represents the Russian spirit of sloth and alcoholism.
Ach. That stump is really eatin into my tractor budget. Ill have to use me explosives.	Explosives? Great!
Explosives? Great!	If we put charges on the load-bearing walls, we can blow up detention hall while leaving the art room unharmed.
Im blowin up the stump, not the school.	Right, right. You never saw that.
Well done, boy!	Wait, here comes the mykeeyah.
Thank you.	So, what are you lookin for?
Family records for a school project on genealogical--	Hey, thats great.
She wasnt a slave owner! Our family was on the Underground Railroad!	We ran a subway station?
No, the Underground Railroad was a bunch of people who helped slaves escape to Canada. There were no actual trains, and it wasnt under ground.	Then they shouldve called it the Above-Ground Normal-Road.
Yes! Im thrilled! Weve regained our family honor and were one-sixty-fourth black!	So thats why Im so cool!
Well, that concludes... I dont really know what that was. Now please take out your homework.	Homework? What homework?
Homework? What homework?	Sixth-graders! Nooooooo!
Well lets see what the rest of you dullards have to offer.	Uh-oh.
Bart Simpson, youve had three months to do this project, you started thirty seconds ago.	Thank you. Thank you.
Irresponsible... unprepared... bad seed...	Good guy...
...bad guy. Signed... ...stamped...and sealed.	So, can I deliver that to the office for you?
Now what are you up to?	Whatever happened to hi?
Hi. Now what are you up to?	A letters comin from school and I need to be home to keep Mom and Dad from getting it.
A letters comin from school and I need to be home to keep Mom and Dad from getting it.	Mommm! I have a fever!
How did you--	I dont want to talk about it.
I dont want to talk about it.	Ive gotta get that letter before Mom and Dad do. Stay focused...
Ive gotta get that letter before Mom and Dad do. Stay focused...	Focused...
Focused...	Focused...
Focused...	Focused...
What the... youre a month behind on homework?!	I tried really hard to stop you from finding out. Does that help?
Its okay, Bart. Just do a couple vocabulary words, then come have some milk and cookies.	But Dad said I had to finish--
Well, sometimes people who agree on most things have one issue that they disagree strongly about. In politics its called a wedge issue -- like illegal immigration or gay marriage.	Wait a minute. Can I play them against each other so I dont have to do any homework at all?
You would mess up Mom and Dads marriage just to get out of doing some homework?	Hey, hey, I would end all life on this planet just to get out of doing fractions.
Fractions arent that hard, you just have to find a common denominator. For example one half plus one third equals...	End. All. Life. On. This. Planet.
Youll need to know fractions to make that explosion!	So much homework... childhood slipping away...
Bart! Put down those books and go play this instant!	If you say so.
Right on time. Grape soda -- shaken, not stirred.	Lets roll.
I said he could take a break.	The violence really relaxes me.
No line... near the mens room... I see no reason to question your choice.	Smooth move, Mom -- tricking Dad into having lunch at the one place that doesnt serve beer.
Congratulations. Youre officially a sociopath.	Hey, at least Im on a path.
Im gonna go paste your heads back into the family photos. Ive got them right here.	Dad, I know youre gonna say no, but Mom would say...
Whatever. Knock yourself out.	What do you mean?
You may not realize this, Bart, but your mother and I have been fighting about you a lot lately. And Ive realized our marriage is more important than your future. From now on, youre on your own.	Really? Okay.
Behold, an ancient subway station!	I never knew Springfield had a subway.
I never knew Springfield had a subway.	Its like a Thomas The Tank Engine we can go inside!
Yeah.	You wont believe how I got home.
Dont know, dont care.	You dont even want to know if I have anything to do with this mysterious seismic activity of late?
...And...	...and Im not feeling the rush.
Bart, at the end of the day, if your parents arent p.o.d, you havent really pranked. Youve gotta take it up a notch.	Really?
If no ones getting ma, are you really being bad? Think about it.	Wow.
Seymour, do something!	Destroy the school, eh?
And when youre out of my sight, you must constantly Twitter me exactly what youre up to, even though I dont know what Twitter is and have no desire to find out.	Aww, you guys are the meanest parents ever. Thank you.
Life stinks, huh?	Totally.
Mom said she was tipped off by a note from me. But you know something? I didnt write this note.	Thats ridiculous. If you didnt write it, who in the world could have?
You wanted to get caught.	Really? How can you be so sure?
Leave it to you to misspell a word you see first thing every morning. But dont worry. Your secrets safe with me. As far as Mom and Dad know, youre just a soulless little psycho.	Thanks, Lis.
You have missed your turn. Recalculating. Turn right in point five meters.	Dad, no! That takes us into a construction site!
You have reached your destination.	Thanks for the ride! / Bye, Dad!
Mrs. Krabappel had to go to Portland. Apparently, the people she hired to de-program her sister from that cult turned out to be an even worse cult.	So, whos gonna take her place? Me, I hope?
Sup, Im Bodhi. Do you surf?	They look like this!
So brave.	Um, this is the last seat, so...
My side. Your side.	Hi, Nikki. Im Bart. This situation, its nuts, right?
Hi, Nikki. Im Bart. This situation, its nuts, right?	Oh look at you, opening a book so you wont have to talk to me. Well Im just gonna be tuning up the old armpit.
Do you mind?!	Oh man, you girls ruin everything -- even vampires.
Hey, vampires are cool outsiders who love girls who hate cheerleaders.	No, theyre all about chomping neck. And they dont put product in their hair like this loser.
Awesome picture.	Can I draw a robot barfing screws on your arm with my Sharpie?
I... Id like that.	Annnnd, finished.
Dad, I know we dont normally talk about this stuff, but theres this girl at school I kind of like.	Anyway, Im really hoping you could... Dad?
Your mother thinks Im working on the car!	Dad, that is genius, but I need some advice--
Talk to Grampa. He used to be a man.	He did?
Theres one sure way to find out if a girl likes you -- steal a kiss!	Really? Did that ever work for you?
You mean second base? Whoa, hes a little young for that.	If I talk to Nikki, Im sure I can--
No! If you go near her one more time, well be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever.	Thats no problem -- Mom can make garbage taste great.
Thank you.	Well, I mean it.
Look at that.	Oh, look at their guts.
Look whos all confused.	Huh?
Huh?	What the hell are you doing?
Kissing you, stupid.	You are the biggest psycho I ever met.
You wanna stop?	Absolutely not.
What about Sodom and Gomorrah?	Yeah, till they find out about us.
What do you mean us?	Well, like, uh, arent you my girlfriend now?
Oh, you mean, like you own me?	Im sorry.
Youre always apologizing.	Just tell me what you want!
You should know what I want!	I want you to act the same way two days in a row! Augggh! I am not gonna let you hurt me anymore.
The student has become the master.	Nikki! Thanks for saving my life.
You know, Ned, God has never given up on anyone.	I dont get you! Youre hot, youre cold... What is your deal?!
Oh Bart, youve got a few things to learn about women. And I will never tell you what they are.	I give up! Smell ya later.
I give up! Smell ya later.	I love youuuuuu!
Mr. Flanders invited us to Israel. I think he wants to get Dad into Heaven.	Great -- more hell for me!
Yes, it is fitting.	Krav ma-wha?
Flanders, youre not supposed to help him.	Yeah, thanks a lot, Flanders.
Dear Lord please fix the following parking tickets A647253, SP90325, Shelbyville 932871...	Sad.
Sad.	Sad.
Sad.	Never gonna happen.
Never gonna happen.	Sad. Maybe, if you were Brad Pitt.
Hey boy, were supposed to be acting religiousy. What are you up to?	Reading prayers and ignoring them, just like God.
Reading prayers and ignoring them, just like God.	Hey, this ones from you.
Hey, this ones from you.	Dear Lord, dont let Marge find out the hotel leaves chocolates on the pillows at night.
Hey, why am I running from a girl?	Call me when youre old enough for your bat mitzvah. Ill bring you an envelope full of nothin.
Call me when youre old enough for your bat mitzvah. Ill bring you an envelope full of nothin.	Ka-ra-tÃ©!
Israeli karate. Less . More .	You dont fight like a girl! Or even a Milhouse!
I dont know what is Milhouse. I work security for the tour. Dealing with American punks like you counts as my military service, and we know all about you.	Ay carumba. Hey, is that the Ark of the Covenant?
Ay carumba. Hey, is that the Ark of the Covenant?	Ka-ra-tÃ©!
Once again, Krav maga!	Quit going for my groin!
Im more than okay! I am the Messiah, come to save the world! Look upon me and shudder!	I already do that.
Ah yes, Jerusalem Syndrome. The name given to religious delusions or psychoses that occur when people visit Jerusalem.	Have you ever noticed that Dad always gets the disease they write about in the in-flight magazine?
Krav maga!	You cant hurt whats already dead.
You cant hurt whats already dead.	I guess you can.
Awww... since its your birthday...	Mom! Im gonna go hurl rotten fruit!
Shopping. Every time this town riots, the malls are deserted. You stay here.	I hate being stuck at home!
Play with Lisa.	Mom, you dont play with Lisa. You play despite her.
Mom, you dont play with Lisa. You play despite her.	Bart, Im not thrilled either. But one day we might need each other for organ transplants, so wed better keep the lines of communication open. Want to help me with my ant farm?
Bart, Im not thrilled either. But one day we might need each other for organ transplants, so wed better keep the lines of communication open. Want to help me with my ant farm?	You plant the ants and then they grow?
No, the ants are the farmers.	Really? What are they growing?
Nothing! Look, do you want to do it or not?	No!
Hey, theyre not eating.	Dont worry. I gave em a Pop Tart. The healthy kind, strawberry-frosted.
You dont have a whisper voice, do you?	Oh Lisa, you take the fun out of everything! I am so glad I am not your kid.
Well, Im so glad Im not your mom.	You should be. If I was in your tummy, Id poo in your throat.
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ill never get that image out of my head!	Oh no. You are not taking the children.
Theres only one ant left!	I will never forgive you.
I will never forgive you.	Aw...
That only angers me more.	I know.
Youre not going anywhere near Annie.	Annie?
As in Little Orphan.	It was an accident! I didnt mean to kill our ants.
Patty and Selma are dead? Woo hoo! A double funeral!	Dad, before you jump to conclusions...
Bart, shes only carrying thirty times her weight. Our girl is slowing down.	Oh my God, that is so sad.
Its the natural order of things. Im afraid shes got another two, maybe three days, tops.	Do we let her spend the rest of her life in the wild? Or let her die in captivity, like Grampa?
Ants have six legs, Bart.	Oh, thank God. I thought I broke two off.
You remember Dylan. You were in Toddle Tots together.	I dont even remember if Dylans a boy or a girl.
Lady, you dont know Dylan.	Carrot cake?!
Disubaki -- goji kick!	Hey, dinks. Whatcha dweebin?
It makes Digimon look like PokÃ©mon.	What?! Impossible!
Hey, Simpson! Think you got all the best Battle-Ball cards? Well, stink again, smellwad. Ralph Wiggums got a platinum lava genie!	Howd a Pull-Up like you get a great card like that?
My not-dead Gramma sent it from Tokyo.	Ralph, I will play you for that card.
Okay, but if I win, you have to teach me how to play this game.	Deal.
Thats drug talk! But I could be mistaken. Let me just listen to a little more, out of context.	This product is unbelievable!
Bart Simpson, are you a drug-o?	What? No! Not until you raise my allowance.
Well, can you explain what you were doing in the basement with Milhouse?	Getting higher and higher...
Oh my gosh, thats adorable! This ones going on the Christmas tree.	Its no fun if my Mom likes them!
Its no fun if my Mom likes them!	Come on, toilet! If you can handle Dad, you can handle this!
You used to be nicer!	When is my turn over?
Bart, please! Im trying to hear Dr. Houses third incorrect diagnosis before his final correct diagnosis!	Dear Lord, youve got the wind I need, Ive got the prayers you crave. Lets make a deal.
Look at the cool stuff that washed up!	Scuba goggles!
Scuba goggles!	Medical waste!
Medical waste!	Huh? / Whoa.
Bart, can you believe that something so mighty has been rendered so powerless?	Im gonna have my next birthday party on this thing.
Check it out! Worlds biggest armpit fart!	You just made a powerful enemy!
The world below the brine / Forests at the bottom of the sea / the Branches and leaves... / Sea-lettuce, vast lichens...	Wake up, Lis!
Wake up, Lis!	Theyre doing it!
Oh Lisa, Im sorry. I tried my best. I know its really hard when you discover your dad isnt perfect.	Not perfect?! You can say that again.
Guess what company had a giveaway at Moes last night?	No. I wont.
Whats it say, boy?	Responsibly.
Youre blond too.	Blonde guys arent dumb. Theyre evil. Like in The Karate Kid and World War Two.
Hey boy, whatcha doing?	Experimenting with my butt.
Sorry, honey. I wasnt listening. And I wont be listening now.	Hey Homer, what do you think Mom meant by taking care of something?
You rebel scum make me sick! This is sweet justice for how you greybacks treated our boys at Andersonville!	Hyaa! Hyaa!
Every time I plan something that means something to me you somehow mess it up.	I need some cash, man.
I need some cash, man.	You will lose all your money. Well see about that!
You had that scar before you got on.	What scar?
Whats that delicious smell?	Cookies!
Stop that sniffing! Its not for you! Theyre making the house next door smell like cookies so people will subconsciously want to buy it.	Oh come on. What kind of big fat moron would fall for...
Water feature...	Dames. Well, Im gonna go introduce myself Bart Simpson style.
Dames. Well, Im gonna go introduce myself Bart Simpson style.	Yo. Bart Simpson. No doubt you read about me in your nuisance neighbor disclosure.
Hello, Bart.	Huh? Say that again.
Hello, Bart.	Sideshow Bob!
Why on earth do you think that harmless-looking man...is Sideshow Bob?	I know he doesnt look like him, but Ill never forget that voice!
Or Lieutenant Commander Tom Dodge in Down Periscope.	Look, Im telling you, no matter who he says he is, hes really Sideshow Bob!
Really? Hm. Maybe I...	Sideshow Bob!
Who am I again?	Yum Yum. Im Peep-bo.
Mom! Dad! I got the lead!	And a one, and a two, and a...
Uh-oh, Bart. Who will sing the next verse?	We need a third maid. Maybe someone will step in and help.
ONE LITTLE MAID IS A BRIDE, YUM YUM.	TWO LITTLE MAIDS IN ATTENDANCE COME.
TWO LITTLE MAIDS IN ATTENDANCE COME.	THREE LITTLE MAIDS... THREE LITTLE MAIDS...
THREE LITTLE MAIDS... THREE LITTLE MAIDS...	THREE... LIT-TLE MAIDS...
It is a good station, Bart, what with the Morning Cattle Drive and Armadillo Mike in the afternoon. And nothing keeps me informed like Rodeo Ricks News Roundup every hour on the--	Shut up.
Ooh, that book I ordered is gonna be delayed.	All right, Walt Warren, lets see who you really are.
All right, Walt Warren, lets see who you really are.	Harmless World, Mild Manners, Not Mad Magazine, Nap Fancy, Calm, Comfortable, a Cuddly Puppies calendar...
Harmless World, Mild Manners, Not Mad Magazine, Nap Fancy, Calm, Comfortable, a Cuddly Puppies calendar...	Aww, the little guy cant get out of the pumpkin. There must be something here!
Aww, the little guy cant get out of the pumpkin. There must be something here!	Something, something, something!
What are you doing?! Youre indoors at an outdoor party!	Walt is Sideshow Bob and Im gonna prove it. Look!
Walt is Sideshow Bob and Im gonna prove it. Look!	Who needs a knife this big?
Its probably a de-boner.	Boner. Mom, Im scared!
Oh, here you go.	That is Bob. Guess I was wrong.
Theyre playing Spokane...	The Cascades?! They totally stole the Federal Cup from us last year! Can I go Mom? Can I?
Is your room clean?	No.
I am... Sideshow Bob!	/
I bought the house next to you, and here we are. So I just have to kill you, then sell the house. Selling the house will be murder.	You could just rent it till the market recovers... whichll be never!
Welcome to Five Corners -- the only geographic location in the U.S. where five states meet, and where you will meet your doom.	Come on, Bob, you dont need to kill me. Ill probably kill myself pretty soon with all the stupid things I do. Oh no, I swallowed my tongue.
Yes... I would be a fool. Unless I did it here, where your murder will be unprosecutable.	You know, the great ones can kill without explaining.
No single act is against any law. But their sum total is the greatest murder since Snape killed Dumbledore!	I havent gotten to that part yet!
Its a four-year-old book!	Im a slow reader!
A fitting epitaph. That means last words.	Are you here to teach me or to kill me?
What in the name of Malcolm Muggeridge are you doing?	Ruining your plan -- if you shoot me while were in the same state, you go to jail.
Oh, Bart. I am so glad everythings okay.	Well, not everything -- apparently someone switched your face with a butt.
That is disgusting.	Hang on, heres a spot that still looks good.
Hang on, heres a spot that still looks good.	So, do we have a winner?
Hmmmm. Not ugly enough. I want something that looks like this...had a baby with this...and it got sat on by this.	I think Ive come up with the answer.
You never fail to nauseate me, boy.	Just call me Barf Simpson.
Half an hour to show time, your ugliness.	Dad, do you realize weve put more time into this than all my schoolwork combined?
But if we win this, we get a gift certificate.	For what?
Another good one...	Huh? Wait a minute, this doesnt look like Oslo. Where are the wood-stave churches? Historic Akershus Fortress?
We gotta find a clip that proves Krustys made a cultural contribution.	Lets see what weve got here. Krusty drunk on The Tonight Show, Krusty drunk on The Today Show, Krusty confesses to self-mutilation on Match Game P.M., Krusty Trips The Pope, Krusty Vomits In Baby Carriage, Krusty Uses Child As Shield, Krusty Celebrity Poker Freak-Out, Krusty Super Bowl Nip Slip Ah, here we are, Krusty On The Electric Company.
Wait! Not so fast! We found something to save Krusty.	And its on this DVD!
Vuvuzela me out of here!	Three days later, South Africa freed Nelson Mandela from prison.
No fair! We just went to church!	Yeah, so weve already heard stories from thousands of years ago, about stuff that didnt happen.
Fifty bucks each?! Thats your life savings?!	This wont even cover the vig on what I owe!
Now remember what Grampa said you can spend the money any way you want.	I just paid some loser fifty bucks to walk up the down escalator all day.
Right. Nice. Good day, Mister Barf-breath.	Dummyball.
Whats a babe like her doing with a brown banana like Skinner?	Maybe shes one of those sexy school- supply company reps.
Bart, call me Walter Matthau, cause Im a bad-news bearer. Im resigning as manager of your Little League team.	What? Why?
In the last game, our shortstop hit a long foul ball, but the umpire called it a homerun... and I let it go without saying a word. I just dont like the monster Ive become.	But without a coach, we cant play!
Son, how would you like to spend the summer building wooden boats by hand with master craftsmen?	Howd you like to kiss my ass?
Look at me, Im Whitey Ford!	Huh?
Huh?	Whats goin on?
We got a new coach!	Awesome! Who is it?
Its me!	Lisa?!
What, you cant stand the idea of a girl coaching a boys baseball team?	No, we cant stand the idea of someone who knows nothing about baseball coaching a baseball team.
Okay, bottom line I need an extra-curricular activity, and no one else will coach you loveable losers.	Were not losers. Last year we finished six and five.
Look, if you want to play liability-insured baseball, Im your only shot.	Fine, you can be our coach.
Thanks. You can be the free safety.	Wrong sport.
I mean the point guard.	Also wrong.
Im gonna do a little research.	A littles not gonna be enough, honey pie.
Dont call me honey pie.	You got it, tootsie pop.
Your spreadsheets!	My stupid sisters taken the fun out of baseball. What happened to stealing bases, the suicide squeeze, throwin a little chin music?
Were no longer cellar dwellers. Well, the team isnt.	This isnt the game I grew up with, the game played in the misty ballparks of Enron Field, or Pac Bell, then S.B.C., now A. T. and T. Park. And from now on, Im gonna play my game.
Bart, this guys walked the last two batters, and if he walks you, we win the game. Dont swing at anything!	But Im on a hot streak.
Hot streaks are a statistical illusion.	I wish you were a statistical illusion.
You disobeyed your manager!	So what? We won.
With me here in the booth is brand new color commentator and former Isotots great, Bart Simpson! Bart, do you miss the game?	No, no, no, no. I got a lot goin on.
Look, Dad! Players and Coaches Entrance!	Well, lets go to the bleachers. I brought an air horn and a megaphone.
Well, lets go to the bleachers. I brought an air horn and a megaphone.	Testing...
Actually, Im taking you on a special little guy super happy fun day!	Are you taking me to the dentist?
Lisa? She wants to talk to you.	Hey Lis.
I didnt know what I was putting into my body.	Sorry sis, Ive moved on, and my days of listening to my manager are over.
How about a benchwarmer whos afraid of puppets?	Did someone order a happy ending?
Okay, okay, hes stolen third. But surely thats the limit of his cockiness...	Im stealing home!
You stink!	Did I make it?
No. But you did do something. You made me love baseball. Not as a collection of numbers, but as an unpredictable, passionate game beaten in excitement only by every other sport.	I guess your computer was right.
Maybe it was, but according to my calculations, youre a great brother fifty-one percent of the time.	And according to my gut, youre okay too.
Yeah, we really racked em up eating all those elf babies.	Nothing beats a weapon made of weapons!
I still think its too violent.	Its a game. Were not hurtin anybody.
Drops And Risers?	Consternation?
Ravenous Ravenous Rhinos?	Mousecatch?
Battleboat?	Funopoly?
Crate of Apes?	Yahtzu?
Tiddlywonks?	Hey, Ive never seen this one before.
Satans Path?	Hey, its gotta be good if Satan put his name on it.
Hey, its gotta be good if Satan put his name on it.	Here, Ill be the demon, you be the thimble.
Oh, Im always the thimble.	One...
One...	...two.
Well be safe on this Battleboat.	Set a course for B-7.
They dunked our battleboat!	I wish I could see my Mom one last time so I can say this is all your fault!
No, I might sink the letter. And Q is just too valuable.	That blank can be any letter we want!
Maybe Im just tired of living.	The final challenge! Mousecatch... a game so lame, no ones ever finished it!
Crazy eights!	Think Bart, think! What was that lesson I learned from videogames? Oh yeah, kill, kill, kill!
Sure is a hard way to catch a mouse.	This stupid thing never works.
Thats it. From now on well just play hangman.	Wait, wait! We still get one more letter!
Is it... three?	Thats not a letter!
Its something youve never seen theyre smitten.	Oh Ive seen it, especially when I do this.
Someday when Im a grownup, maybe Ill go back and look fondly at our house.	Well, stop in and say hi to me cause Ill still be there -- chillin in my basement bachelor pad.
Be sure to water the flowers on my backyard grave.	As long as I can dig you up and stick you on the front porch every Halloween.
Just dont dress me up like a woman.	Well see.
This was my bedroom! My bedpost smooshes are still in the carpet!	I wanna go read books in the car.
There are no books in the car.	I just wanna sit in the car!
I dont even know why I pay taxes.	Comin through!
Comin through!	Just when you think Im out of ideas!
Look at you, struttin around, like youre Toad of Toad Hall.	Im just whistlin, man.
You think youre so smart, dontcha, Simpson?	Were both in the same reading group. I think you know how smart I am.
Bart did it again!	Im not a bully! Its just a series of incredible coincidences!
Its plenty good! Its great! Its just... not for me.	School bus!
What kind of kiss did you get?	Normal. You?
Ice cold.	Youre just imagining things.
Oh yeah?	Hm.
Hm.	What does your note say?
I can get to you whenever I want, Simpson. But Im gonna bide my time. You wont even hear the punch that wastes you. And youll crack like one of those chicken turds rich people eat.	You mean an egg?
Let me outta here so I can put you in here!	Ha! Youre not so tough now.
I dont wanna talk about it.	A kid at schools gonna beat me up.
Is it Milhouse?	Milhouse couldnt beat me up.
Are you sure? Hes having a growth spurt.	Its not Milhouse!
Is it a girl?	Its Nelson!
Well, if hes got you cornered, and Milhouse isnt there to help you, theres only one way out make him feel good about himself.	How do I do that?
I dont know, compliment his glasses.	Its not Milhouse!
...make him feel good about himself.	Uh, Nelson... for someone who never goes to the dentist, you have pretty good teeth.
Theyre dentures!	Uh... you do a lot with a limited wardrobe!
Thats Social Worker talk for Im poor.	Uh, uh, you punch really good!
You think?	Oh yeah! And-and you always avoid the face around picture day. People appreciate that.
Hey, those memories are forever.	You really care, man. A lot of bullies just phone it in. Kearney.
I dont know! They wont tell me! And besides... you were willing to do all this just so I would be happy! Mom, Id be honored if I turned out like you.	Mom, thanks to you, this box sucker didnt beat me up!
Hold, please.	My poop stick has brought him back to life! But which end?
My poop stick has brought him back to life! But which end?	What do you want?
What do you want?	Cmon, man, leave me alone.
You my mommy-daddy-puppy?	Whoa! Your brains have turned to oatmeal!
My name Oatmeal?	This is too weird, man.
Whats all that noise?	Im playing with my Sergeant Activity Doll.
Hm... Well, okay.	Okay, okay. Ill find you some food.
Thank God Mr. Burns isnt alive to see this.	Come back! Im not finished giving you your bath!
Now boy, everyone in town gets Burns for half an hour to do as they will.	This town cant teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge.
Okay, Burnsie, follow the carrot!	Dad, youre gonna wreck him for everybody!
The poor guy hurt his wing.	I bet its a combination to a safe!
Or, more likely, the phone number of the birds owner.	Ask about the safe. No, better yet, act like you know about the safe.
Looks like youre gonna have to take care of him, Bart.	Me? Just what in my long, sad history with frogs makes you think I can take care of a bird?
No, no... Listen, dont tell anyone, but... I cant stand pigeons! Theyre like rats with wings!	Hes crawling on your arm.
Okay, Ray, your wing is healed. Go on. Live your life.	Aw, cmon, man. Admit it -- you knew this day would come.
Aw, cmon, man. Admit it -- you knew this day would come.	You and I have shared too many seed bells to just walk away from this.
Haw-haw.	Man, you were not into that. Whats wrong?
All finished, boy.	That coop looks a little flimsy.
Mom, its just Maggie.	Now that youre officially my bird, let me fill you in on the pecking order around here.
Now that youre officially my bird, let me fill you in on the pecking order around here.	The top dog is me, followed by the top dog, the dog... ...then the cat... then you... but dont feel bad, youre ahead of Milhouse.
I thought your race car was a Transformer! Nothings one thing anymore!	Sorry man, its still too soon.
Caesar can have his eagle, Alexander the Great his gryphon... Ill take the American fighting pigeon any damn day!	Wow, Ray, you have hidden talents!
Is he good at tic-tac-toe like that chicken I played, lost to, and ate at the State Fair?	No, I was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth.
What the? All right. I wont ask who sent this note if I can use the bird to send a note of my own.	As long as it means were not learning.
Hey, if it moves, you can bet on it.	What about the Detroit Lions?
What they dont suspect is that Im into this.	Hear that, boy? Youre gonna be a racing pigeon!
Hear that, boy? Youre gonna be a racing pigeon!	Its getting a little chilly -- Id better put a blanket on Ray.
Its getting a little chilly -- Id better put a blanket on Ray.	Dad! Help!
Stupid dog! Let go of that delicious bird!	Nooooo!
GRAY SKIES ARE GONNA CLEAR UP / PUT ON A HAPPY FACE / BRUSH OFF THE CLOUDS AND CHEER UP / PUT ON A HAPPY FACE	Thanks. That song does make me feel a little better.
Ah, yes. A little hair of the dog that bit me.	I hope you learned something here.
Secondly, theres been a major breach of trust between Bart and Santas Little Helper.	Well, he shouldnt kill birds. Its not right!
That is correct... according to human standards. But all a dog can do is follow his animal inclinations, right?	I guess.
...maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive him.	See? Hes a questionable character! He used to hang around racetracks, you know!
No! For once, a pet going to a farm upstate really is going to a farm upstate.	What about all the other pets you told us went to a farm upstate?
I mailed them the answer but they never printed it.	But its not my fault youre leaving, its yours. Because you should never, ever kill a bird. Ever!
But its not my fault youre leaving, its yours. Because you should never, ever kill a bird. Ever!	Id like a moment to ourselves.
Never kill a bird. Never kill a bird.	Why you little...
More Oxycontin Candy, sweetie?	Well, boy, I guess I owe you an apology. Whos a bird-eating monster? You are. You are! Yes you are!
Now to take care of the witnesses.	Hey, I need those cookies for Santa.
At least someone around heres got the Christmas spirit.	Yep. Come midnight, Ill be sittin here with cold cookies, warm milk, and hot lead.
What?	For the last three years, Ive asked that rosy-cheeked nog-hog for a dirt bike. And all he brought me was a zillion lame-o toys that I immediately broke and threw in this bag.
But you wanted those toys.	I wanted them till I got them! But this year Im gettin my dirt bike.
Even Mac Davis himself couldnt save this Christmas.	Great, Mom. Now I lost track of my pump count. One pump, two pump...
Bowl full of jelly, pump lead in his belly...	Wha?
Direct service to the North Pole, with stops at Candy Cane Corners, Sugarplum Square, Jack Frost Junction, Fa La La La Lane, Nutcracker Street, and Hanukah Heights.	Some express.
Elf! Im an elf!	Whatever you say. Um, look, how do I get to Santa?
After NAFTA, a lot of these jobs went to the South Pole.	Well, who needs wrapping paper anyway? Just stick a bow on the toy and youre ready to go.
Well, who needs wrapping paper anyway? Just stick a bow on the toy and youre ready to go.	Bow, bow, bow, bow, bing, bang, boom!
So youre the brown nosed reindeer thats jingled all the way to the top.	Just point me to Santa.
Oh, I know what youre after. The toy you never got.	Youre outta your elfin mind!
Oh really? Well let me ask you this, how many kids bring a gun to meet Santa?	Okay. You got me. But Im gettin my dirt bike -- and you cant stop me.
Kid... this companys bust. For years Ive been giving out free toys and gettin cookies in return. Its not a sustainable business model.	Oh cmon, man. Things arent that bad.
Theyre pretty bad. Im eating my own reindeer here!	You win.
You go home now. And maybe therell be a nice pair of work socks under your tree.	You dont have to do that. I have socks. Ill give you socks!
Whose turn is it to cry?	Yours.
O TANNENBAUM, O TANNENBAUM...	...WIE TREU SIND DEINE BLÃ„TTER!
Why would you want to shampoo it out?	Me and Milhouse had a snowball fight, then an ice-ball fight, then a fight-fight!
You boys want to play soldier?	I cant think of a better way to spend Jesus birthday.
Merry Christmas, Mom!	We brought you breakfast in bed!
Just as soon as we sing one Christmas carol.	Oh man, not the lame-o Twelve Days of Christmas.
TWENTY-NINE SMITHS A-FORGING / TWENTY-EIGHT COOPERS COOPING...	We did that one already!
Come on, Bart. Afraid of a little apple juice?	Pig in a blanket!
Dads underwear!	Aunt Selmas leg!
I hate New Years Eve. I cant believe I made out with Ryan Seacrest on the TV screen.	Lets just take it easy.
Lets just take it easy.	We all made mistakes on New Years Eve.
We all made mistakes on New Years Eve.	There is only one upside to today.
I didnt. I got secondhand wasted from smooching your father. So not a peep out of anyone till the Fiesta Bowl!	Thats not for five hours!
Its okay, its okay. I can be out in eighteen months with good behavior.	Were Simpsons, Dad. We dont do good behavior.
Dear Lord, watch over my sweet Homie while hes in the hoosegow.	Keep him safe from shanks and shivs. Let him become rich in the jailyard currencies of cigarettes and dried fish...
Where do you want your ball mark? Face or belly?	How about... in your dreams!
Challenge accepted.	Rumble it is. After school. Rain or shine.
Is this a rumble or a harvest dance?	Okay, you want hardwood?
No, no, no, no.	Then lets do this thing!
Bless you.	Whered you get that scar?
When did this happen?	You sure none of you guys gave me this?
Cant start the day without that fresh-from-the-circus feeling.	Mom, do you have any idea how I got this scar?
I was afraid this day would come.	Ew, youre sitting on the toilet.
But they were a bad influence on you.	Ah, such an innocent time. Before cooties ravaged our community. How come we dont get together anymore?
The Moms and I had a falling out, which was a shame. We had been such good friends.	Whoa. You dont look like a mom, you look happy.
We called ourselves the Cool Moms.	Theres nothing cooler than calling yourself cool.
Maybe we could get back together...	Awesome! Ill get the white wine.
You cant buy white wine!	Why not? Are you having red meat?
Because youre my best friend in the room.	Wow! We all have the same scar!
More like all day every day.	Cowabungaaa--
Im glad you had fun, because were all getting together next week.	Great, great.
Right... neither am I.	Listen, any of you guys wanna play Old Maid?
Dont tell a chicken when to cluck.	Youre not the chicken, Im the chicken!
Bart?	Hey.
Hey.	They dared me to see how many TV remotes I could stick in my mouth.
Weve got to stop Mom from going out with those women.	Something drove them apart once before...
Something drove them apart once before...	And I bet it has something to do with this scar.
Ive seen this mark before... On you, every time you come in! I believe it had something to do with Comic Book Guy.	Comic Book Guy! Thanks.
I knew this day would come. Although frankly, I thought it would have been a long time ago. You are very uncurious about your body.	All right, Comic Book Guy, tell me my origin story.
I will not relive the horror of that day! The answer is no, and I can say it in Naavi or Klingon, which are pretty much the same. I have some theories on that which I will share with you never!	You leave me no choice. I hold in my hands a mint-condition copy of the legendary Interesting Stories Number Twenty-Seven.
Oh! Oh! The first appearance of Radioactive Man!	And if you dont tell us what we want to know...
How do I know that is not a cheap reprint?	Are you willing to take that chance?
Behold Melkor, proudest of the Ainu!	Look pal, weve gotta speed this up.
Hey, does Dad know you and the cool moms broke up?	I go to see those other guys, we blow this junk up, once again Mom decides that theyre a bad influence on me, and she stops seeing those women who make her so happy.
Yes, you may.	Mom, Ill admit it I wanted to create a devastating explosion to get back my Mom.
I love you kids with all my heart, but dammit, I need something for myself!	I made you a coffee mug on Mothers Day! Isnt that enough?
Its close, but no.	I could light these, but, it wouldnt be the same.
I think they were never my friends... Maybe true friends arent random people you meet at a Mommy and Me class. Theyre random people you meet in a college dorm.	Maybe Lisa and I can be friends -- not with each other, but with you.
Simpson, heres my plan. Ms. Juniper is divorced, and her daughter Melody is in the third grade.	Oh yeah, her. Classic space case.
Well, if you took space case on a date... and brought me to chaperone along with her mother...	I see how it is. You get a booty call and I get a cootie call. Well, its gonna cost ya.
How would you like two weeks of spring break?	Triple spring break plus four weeks at Christmas.
No, if... if the state finds out theyll shut us down!	Okay, have fun dying alone.
I cant believe Im playing videogames with Bart Simpson. Ive sketched you so many times in my dream journal.	Great, baby. Get me some more tokens.
Skin-ner! Youre a regular Casanova. Or in English, new house.	Come on, come to life! I swear Ill be cool about it.
Can I do a handstand against you?	Sure.
Sure.	Melody, youre a great girl, but... I see you as more of a sister... and I dont like my sister.
Well, it could have been a day, it could have been the rest of my life.	And?
It was only a day.	Youve been gone for three months!
So anyway, thats why me and Nana are taking a break.	Stupid cheap bike! To think I was gonna put fenders on you.
Stupid cheap bike! To think I was gonna put fenders on you.	Oh. My. God.
Oh. My. God.	I think I just met the thing Im gonna die on.
I think I just met the thing Im gonna die on.	I gotta have that mini-bike!
Ive found my new look!	Those are girl overalls.
Because when you get anything you want, you dont want anything you get.	What is this crap? Are you wearing a wire?
Someday youll understand that Im just being a good dad.	Are you kidding? Youre the worst dad who ever lived! Id rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you!
Son, I wont strangle you anymore, but I also wont get you that mini-bike.	How bout this? I let you punch me in the face and you get me a snowmobile.
Im busy.	Dont you minimize me!
Fine. Just get in here.	How can I earn money to buy the worlds most awesome thing?
You could deliver newspapers.	Kids dont deliver newspapers anymore. Its just creeps in trucks.
Maybe if you buckle down and get good grades, dad will give you money.	Does he give you money for getting good grades?
You just said My car is full of ice cream!	Dad, if I get an A on my math test, would that be worth some money?
And if you do it, son, youll get the same.	Theres no way that means anything other than I get a mini-bike. To the library!
Tis the playground ghost! I swear, I didnt mean to kill ya!	Its me, Willie. Bart Simpson.
THERE ONCE WAS AN ALIEN WHOSE MOTHER CALLED HIM TREY / FROM THE FANCIEST PLANET IN THE MILKY WAY / STOLE HIS DADS SHIP / TOOK IT FOR A TRIP / SAW LAKE ERIE ON HIS RADAR AND HE THOUGHT HED TAKE A DIP	I did it! I got an A!
Son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work.	What the? I wanted a mini-bike! I told all my friends I was getting one!
Well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they werent really your friends.	Yes they were! But now they wont be! Because I dont have a mini-bike!
Um... well... of course you did!	A gutter cleaning coupon?
Just transfer everything to this flash drive.	I dont know... can I really betray my country? I say the pledge of allegiance every day.
Hes buying it!	Aw, and they gave me my own vanity plate.
Youre gonna love meeting my friends.	Where the hell did that come from?
Where the hell did that come from?	No! Why in the world would you get me this?
Because youve been such a great kid lately and I wanted to show you I appreciated it.	Oh. Thats great. I wouldnt trade it for all the tea in China?!
1	Its still here! Yes! I get the flash drive back and the manila envelope.
Unbelievable! / Terrible!	Masters, I can explain.
Then you leave us no choice.	A teddy bear?
Step away from the traitor!	Dad!
Okay, now Ill translate that into romance language.	I dont want to talk about my Moms hair.
I love it. I know I use the word empowering a lot, but this time it really is that.	I just have one question about hair. Where does mine start? Head, head, head, hair... wheres the border?
Oh my God, me too!	What are we?!
Right. Its just weird. Normally I think your mom is hot--	Take that back!
Im sorry. What I mean is, shes not hot any more...	Take that back!
Whats bothering you, son?	I... I dont want to talk about it.
Remember, Bart, anything you say here is confidential.	Can we close the door?
Dont judge them too harshly. They recently learned they were once two-thirds of conjoined triplets. And the third one is out for revenge. Now Bart, share your most intimate thoughts with me.	I dont think I want to.
Oh... Well, maybe itd be easier for you to talk to my colleague Doctor Thera-bear.	Well...
Hold on. Im not allowed in the room while you talk to the bear.	All right, I know theres a camera in you somewhere.
No. Its oddly dehumanizing.	Hey Dad, did you color your hair too?
Bai chi.	So, the familys still gone. What do I do now?
Let me freshen that up for ya.	I love Saturdays!
Im gonna kill ya, boy!	Im bored.
Bart, do you remember this?	Thats Angry Dad! The semi-autobiographical web cartoon I created!
...and most importantly, Angry Dad. Because now I want to make it into a movie.	My stupid cartoon a movie? Thank you!
Bart, weve got some bad news -- the actor who did the original voice of Angry Dad cant do the movie. He blew out his voice screaming about how he never got paid the first time around.	Oh, man. What can we do?
You know, your movies not all bad. If you cut out the stuff that didnt work, it would make a great short film.	A short film?
Many great directors, like Wes Anderson, Frank Tashlin, and Tim Burton started with short films.	Name one more.
Taylor Hackford.	I dont know who that is, but Im convinced. Lets start cutting.
Buon Giorno! Where is-a the Bart Simpson?	I am the Bart.
Dont worry, sweetie, this is just the first of way too many awards shows. Youll get your chance to say ridiculous things.	My category comes up pretty soon. Im home free as long as this Oscar show is tight and fast-paced.
Old on -- Im earing my etainer.	Angry Dad got an Oscar nomination?!
Angry Dad got an Oscar nomination?!	IM GOING TO THE OS-CARS! NOT AS A SEAT FILL-ER! ILL GET A GIFT BAS-KET! BUT I WONT DE-CLARE IT!
Hey! Dont you know its awards season? Whos calling you at five in the morning anyway?	Uh... nobody. Wrong number.
Its Bart Simpson, writer-director of Angry Dad, and you are with...	My lame-o sister, Lisa.
And wheres the Angry Dad himself? Wheres Homer Simpson?	Homer? Well, I dont know. L.A.s a world-class city with a lot to offer. Hes probably enjoying the sights...
When most people think of animated movies, they think of forty minutes or more. But there is another type of animated film -- forty minutes or less!	Conductor, get ready to play my song!
And for Best Animated Short, the Oscar goes to... wait, one last moment about me... every night I dream my teeth fly out of my mouth. Angry Dad!	Yes!
Yes!	This is it... I finally get to accept an award for my movie...except its not just my movie. It was my sisters idea to make this into a short. And so many animators... every day was somebodys birthday. And you know what? It was my Dads movie too. I only wish he were here and not at Cerritos Auto Square.
You got your wish, boy. Im proud of ya. Im sorry I took all the credit.	This whole thing is silly. I mean, isnt the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard?
Did you find gold?	Better -- the prospectors left naughty French postcards!
Better -- the prospectors left naughty French postcards!	Whoa, mama.
That doesnt seem fair -- they wont let him escape, then they kick him out. I wonder where hell go.	Either the grave or somewhere much worse.
Nose in a funny book, how rude! Aint ya never heard of conversation?	Fine. Hows it goin?
Why are you guys eating so fast?	Trying to get out of here before Grampa wakes up.
Thats him!	Mom, quick! Our lunches!
Here ya go, champ! Go buy yourself some rock-and-roll records.	To the antique store!
These are my Suitcase Suzies, who will use their beauty and free giveaways to make sure our drug is prescribed.	Cool! Are they robots?
I am not Willy Wonka!	No, no. Youre Augustus Gloop, the fat German boy!
Grampapa, no one but you should take this drug until it has been through rigorous trials. Be careful -- if the wrong hands got hold of it, a fortune could be made by selling this drug on the black market.	Hm, wrong hands, eh? Thats your cue, boys.
Even your acid wants outta you!	Ive got something you can stuff in that old bag.
No! Ive been moistened!	Ive got some stuff to put a smile on that corpse.
At some point I think we should see a doctor.	No, its cool -- its like weve got our own monster!
It better be tonsillitis.	Well, actually... I may have accidentally traded a few of those pills, for money...
The duos herbal ha-has led to a series of successful albums, concerts, movies, and Nash Bridges. Now, these homegrown heroes will kick off their summer tour at Squidports new Amphitheatre -- the Clamphitheater.	Who the hell are Cheech and Chong?
Bart, Cheech and Chong were the Beavis and Butthead of their day!	Who are Beavis and Butthead?
Hide the dope!	We dont have any dope.
Oh no! Chong is refusing to fall back on his old catch-phrases.	Ay carumba!
So, how was your first day of school?	I met the new principal, Mr. Baumgartner. He seemed really cool. When he walked through the gym, he shot a basket!
This belt has caused too many fights between us.	How now, mad spirits, before we part / Tis I, mischievous and puckish Bart / Twas not I the players did disturb / Twas the doings of a green and naughty herb / The gods have righted every wrong / Cheech the stoner has his Chong!
How now, mad spirits, before we part / Tis I, mischievous and puckish Bart / Twas not I the players did disturb / Twas the doings of a green and naughty herb / The gods have righted every wrong / Cheech the stoner has his Chong!	And Homer, he is back with Mom / you can watch this tomorrow at Hulu.com.
Come on, party pooper -- bust a move!	Eh. This songs a little bossy for me.
Aw, come on, sourpuss. Tickle tickle!	Stop it!
Tickle tickle too!	Cut it out!
Tickle-tickle-who-wants-a-pickle!	What does that mean?!
The child has wetted his trousers!	Dad, how could you do that? The whole audience saw me pee my pants!
Im on a European vacation, but youre-a peein everywhere. Oui oui!	Why did I agree to moderate this teleconference?
Hello, boy.	Homer.
I want you to know Im cured.	Good for you. No more drinkin?
Go ahead -- just try to provoke me.	I just got up, man.
Oh come on, bust your daddys chops.	Fine.
Boy, get down from there!	Okay, first Ill send down my shoes.
Bart Simpson! What would your father say if he knew what you were doing?	Hed say Im a grown man whos scared of my own son.
I find that hard to believe.	Oh yeah? Look.
How many more, sir?	Fill the board then wash my car.
These are my keys.	What was that?
Its A-B-C-1-2-3! Its the easiest song in the world!	You think youre better than the Great Simpsini?!
You think youre better than the Great Simpsini?!	Well youre not!
Well youre not!	Whatre you gonna do, write a book about me?
Whatre you gonna do, write a book about me?	You couldnt get in the door of Random House if your name was Bennett Cerf the Third!
You couldnt get in the door of Random House if your name was Bennett Cerf the Third!	One, two, three, cry! One, two, three, cry!
One, two, three, cry! One, two, three, cry!	Hows that water, wet like your tears?
Hows that water, wet like your tears?	Precious, is that you?
Precious, is that you?	Yes, Mama.
Yes, Mama.	You think youre so pretty? Wheres my Lotto ticket?!
You think youre so pretty? Wheres my Lotto ticket?!	I forgot, Mama.
I forgot, Mama.	And dont you come back without it! You hear me?! Hurry up!
And dont you come back without it! You hear me?! Hurry up!	I dont see many more movie roles for a girl like you! Not unless George Lucas needs another death star!
I dont see many more movie roles for a girl like you! Not unless George Lucas needs another death star!	No! Stop! No Star Wars parodies!
Three steps right...	Two to the left.
Now Bart, you do understand youre supposed to avoid the cacti...	Sure do. Im just bad at counting. Two to the right...
Well? Anything?!	Cant look. Texting.
Bart, Im trying to get you to feel something for your father!	I feel something for him. Here it comes.
Pretty sweet, eh boy?	Yknow, I was skeptical, but I guess therapy works.
Oh man. I cant believe we have to pick the peaches ourselves. This activity is so lame Im gonna daydream about school.	Dammit, a pop quiz!
OH, THE YEARS FIRST PEACH, IS A JUICY PEACH / AND HE SINGS A HAPPY TUNE! / AND THE YEARS SECOND PEACH IS A GROUCHY PEACH / MORE LIKE A PRUNE! / NOW, THE YEARS THIRD PEACH IS A--	How many verses does this song have?
Initiate phase two.	I forget what phase two is, but Ill assume we just dump the peaches like we discussed.
Affirmative.	Ill assume that means yes.
Roger.	The names Bart.
Its made for the American market.	Gentlemen, I think I have the solution to your problem.
He is great. In fifty-seven, I saw him turn the Secretary of Agriculture into the Secretary of the Interior! It was hell on their wives, but it sure brought down corn prices. Built a house outta corn. Worst house I ever owned. When it got real hot it smelled like Fritos. People would come from miles around--	Lisa cant be a magician -- thats my thing! Im the one that got a magic set for Christmas two years ago.
Need some help?	Kid scissors. Lame.
I want my pot of gold!	Aye ca-rum-ba.
My friends call me Lisa.	She has no friends.
Now, once again, one of the most promising young magicians I have ever seen the Great Simpsina! Knock em dead, kid. Ill be in my dressing room.	Tell me if she falls.
I was standing in this line to use the bathroom, but now my license is expired.	Hey Dad, theres an arcade across the street... and theres really no point in all of us waiting in line...
Woo hoo! First in line! Brought you a gift bag.	All thats left is banana Runts! Thats the worst Runt!
All thats left is banana Runts! Thats the worst Runt!	Back of the line, stranger!
We used our last day of summer vacation standing in this line, and now its time for our reward.	Next in line! What am I bid for next in line?!
My lick.	My lick.
My lick.	Hey -- you licked the back! That was my side!
Brother germs!	Sister spit!
Bart, this is a truffle.	Youre a truffle.
A truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots. Its one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world.	Only you can make tree poop boring.
Eh? Jody Maroni! But where is your truffle pig?	Youre lookin at him.
How many truffles did you get?	More than I can count.
Brown gold... Tuscan tea...	Just think of what we can do with that moolah.
Bart, I am putting this money safely in the bank where you will earn zero point zero zero one percent interest.	Thats a lot of zeros! You know, all this truffle hunting has made me a little thirsty. Can we go home now?
Three more big ones and well talk.	How big?
As big as a babys head.	Okay.
That tick sure done swelled you up, Normalhead Joe.	Oh, man!
The money? No, no, no, no, no, no. The money is working for us -- whats not working is your stupid sense of smell!	All I smell here is desperation.
No more distractions! Find those truffles! Mush!	If you think that makes me a better musher, youre wrong. Wait a second...
The truffles right over here!	Truffles in your room? I thought youd been selling them!
Truffles in your room? I thought youd been selling them!	Bart... I havent been selling the truffles. Ive been eating them.
Bart... I havent been selling the truffles. Ive been eating them.	Really? Why?
Really? Why?	Vegetarian food is so boring! Pasta, soy... you know whats a bad pizza topping? Broccoli!
Vegetarian food is so boring! Pasta, soy... you know whats a bad pizza topping? Broccoli!	But I worked so hard! Ive got dirt under my fingernails Ill never get out. Not that Im gonna try.
Im sorry, Bart! Take the last truffle... do whatever you want. Sell it, eat it...	Or give it to someone who deserves it.
You spent your life searching for these, but you never had one.	Well, this is yours.
You say such cute little...	I jumped in front of your picture! Now its ruined!
You just ruined six months work!	Im really sorry it wasnt a year.
Youre gonna regret the day you were born!	I already do! Its too close to Christmas!
Not to worry.	Now what?
Cool! / Awesome!	Isnt this the greatest day ever?!
Isnt this the greatest day ever?!	There are no more great days, Bart. Just days.
There are no more great days, Bart. Just days.	Whats wrong, man?
Well, Ive worn a lot of different braces in my time.	This dame is really into you!
Why would a popular fifth-grader like Taffy be interested in a Milhouse like Milhouse?	I dunno. Its one of those mysteries, like how do my clothes get clean and put back in my drawers?
Hmm...	Hey, thats Taffys page. Ooh, I see that shes in a relationship.
Shut up! I just want to know what shes up to with Milhouse. A girl like her could get a fifth grader -- maybe even Kyle LoBianco!	I hear he goes to California on his vacations.
You like my boots?	Once you get past the sister ick, theyre fine.
Maggies locked in!	With the keys!
Whats this key with the plastic skull for?	Thats the key to my box with the real skull.
At some point we should try to return these keys to their rightful owners.	Are you nuts?! Lets have some fun!
Time to get my mischief on!	Lets start with a little federal crime.
Oh, the laser eyes! Why did I give it to him?!	What the? I tried to do bad and I did good!
Maybe this key will be the key to putting the key in anarchy.	The last place anybody would expect to see a moon the sky!
Im alive! And youre my naked fairy-god-boy.	Aw jeez, I hope no one heard you say that.
Skinners involved in this. Deep.	Crazy classroom, bus full of missing kids... I know whod have some answers. Someone whos been here a long, long time.
So the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge.	But its summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing.
Bart, take the controls!	What videogame is this like?
Blimp Assassin Three.	For Wii or Xbox?
Xbox.	Original or Three-Sixty?
Boy! Stomp on my head!	Yes! And Ive got gum on my shoe!
I cant find the key!	Looking for something?
Yes. My car key.	Does it look like... this?
No one cancels my free play!	Sorry, man.
Psst! Mrs. K!	Down here!
Havent you caused enough trouble?	You shouldnt suffer for my bad deed. It should just go unpunished forever.
What else do you wanna talk about?	Meet me in the bathroom.
Meet me in the bathroom.	Check this out a dead possum.
Check this out a dead possum.	Aye carumba!
Okay, Bart, whats going on? Im a teacher in a bathroom with a student. Thats why most of these people are here in the first place.	Mrs. K., Im here to spring you.
Well, thats kind of you. Especially after I nearly choked the life out of you.	You didnt do that.
But I cant just wander out of here whenever I feel like it.	Who says youre leaving?
You made a dummy of me?	Mm, I use it to workshop my pranks.
Mm, I use it to workshop my pranks.	Now follow me!
I dont know about this.	I cant believe a middle-aged woman is scared of a three-story drop.
Its pinot grigio time!	See ya tomorrow, Teach.
Yes. And the way things are going, youre going to be seeing me here a lot.	Even on snow days?
Its due tomorrow -- no excuses.	But... what if my dog eats it?
Thats the dog thats always eating your homework?	Yeah... um... he hates how learning has taken me to a place hell never go. See?
Yeah... um... he hates how learning has taken me to a place hell never go. See?	Hang on. Wait a minute.
And Ill just take my tumbleweed back...	See, Dad? Having Krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. Teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. Were natural enemies, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.
Dont panic, son. We can bust up Teachy and Preachy. Heres what we do Ill take Flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. You scare Rod and Todd by telling them Krabappel will become their evil stepmother.	If fairy tales have taught us one thing, its that first wives are perfect, second wives are horrible.
Wanna see me load a bobbin?	No, I...
I am a female!	Wait, this tastes different.
I put a slice of apple in it!	Gross!
You know I hate surprises!	You tricked us!
Well, if anyone saves my Homies life, they get a free meal. Which actually comes up about once a week.	So Wayne, howd you learn all those cool self-defense moves?
You want to give it zero stars?	I admit it! I let Milhouse lie down in your bed!
Kids, can I talk to Wayne alone a minute?	Remember everything they say and tell us later in rattle code.
Remember everything they say and tell us later in rattle code.	What do you mean no?
What gives, man? Whered you learn that stuff?	If I told you Id have to kill you. Can I tell ya?
I am Edith Knickertwist, an eccentric widow.	For this masterpiece I bid...one thousand dollars!
And our windfall is all thanks to our dear new friend on the phone.	Allo, luvs!
Ive got a bad feeling about this.	Im Mrs. Knickertwist! And Ive had a proper hardy-har at your expense!
While Im on a roll Im gonna call that carpet cleaning service and tell them our hallway doesnt count as a room! Hello, is AndrÃ© there? Oh yes, Ill hold!	...stacks of resumes in back seat...
So, Simpson, youll be studying with me now.	Same garbage, different dumpster.
Now Im sure you know who these gentlemen are.	Dollar bill guy, five dollar bill guy, sex guy, Will Ferrell, black guy.
Bart, what if I told you there was a president who was an actual cowboy?	Id act like Im interested, but inside Id be bored.
Thats as good a place to start as any.	Hey, this Roosevelt guy was sorta interesting. Did you know he was a colonel in the army?
You dont say...	And one time, during a speech, he was shot by a saloon-keeper -- but Teddy finished his speech before heading to the hospital!!
Yknow, I hate to say it, Bart, but the library is about to close.	Really? I wanted to learn more about trust busting. Take that, Standard Oil!
Tomorrow, son. Tomorrow.	Well, Ive learned a lot today. Now to go home and let TV slowly rot it all away.
Eh-eh-eh-eh. Not so fast. Teddy Roosevelt believed you could learn from books. But he also believed you could learn just as much from the out-of-doors.	I thought teachers only went outdoors to smoke and cry.
Yes... Son, have you ever seen a horse your father wasnt betting on?	No sir.
So Bart, what have you learned so far?	Well, when horses poop, they dont stop. They just keep walking.
Uh, yes. Well heres another fun fact for you. All around you is a national park... created by Teddy Roosevelt.	Wow. And here I thought God created all this. Thanks for setting me straight.
Well, wait, I didnt mean that...	Youve filled my head with horse poop and atheism! And all these years I thought I was unteachable.
A man who is good enough to shed his blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.	Just quoting our twenty-sixth president, Lis. You could use a little T.R. in your life.
Please! I went through my T.R. phase in first grade. Now I realize that the greatest Roosevelt is Franklin.	Balderdash! Teddy Roosevelt protected Americas wildlife!
Face on a dime!	Face on a mountain!
The dude really knew how to rock some jodhpurs!	Hey, maybe Chalmers would let you guys sit in on our lessons. After me, men!
Bart Simpson?	Chalmers would actually take us out to see the rocks.
You can see the rocks on page thirty-two of your science book.	My book is missing page thirty-two.
Put your head on the desk and shut your eyes.	My desktop is sticky with soda from the kid that had it before me.
Stupid fish! Dont you want to be my din-ner?!	Hey, Gary.
Simpson, you are looking at a man who was not good enough for the worst public school in America.	Well, what would Teddy Roosevelt do?
Later, losers.	Im thinking of something big. So big it involves taking over the entire school and not giving it up till Chalmers gets his job back!
Bart, your mother thinks theres something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse.	Well, Dad, since you are taking an interest in us, maybe I should tell you...
Yeah.	Theres a car with its lights on in the teachers lot.
Theres a car with its lights on in the teachers lot.	Late-90s model...coffee stains on front seat...
Late-90s model...coffee stains on front seat...	Taking over the school. With all the kids inside!
What?! Im telling Mom!	Great. You can call her from the closet phone.
Hello, Mom? You wont believe what Barts doing.	There really is a phone in there?
There really is a phone in there?	So immature.
So immature.	Yo, teachwads! The Brotherhood of the Spectacles has taken over the school!
Bart, open this door now -- or I will jiggle the handle indefinitely!	Suit yourself. We all rubbed it with boogers.
Oh, I guess you can.	Okay, weve gotta stay focused Jimbo, gather all the students in the gym. Milhouse, take a nap. You know how cranky you get.
Attention, Brotherhood of the Spectacles you are ordered to immediately evacuate the school, and then return to school where you belong.	I need to know that Chalmers will be taken care of!
Its time for you to stand down, son. When I met you, you were nothing more than a thick file of infractions. Now I see a young man Im proud to call my disciplinary problem.	Thanks. But these rough riders arent dismounting until you get your job back.
Its beautiful, man! Its beautiful!	Oh my God. Milhouse, did you take your nap?
Does it look like I took my nap?	Ay carumba!
No question Night at the Museum.	One or two?
Take your pick, you cant go wrong.	Dad? Dad?
Come on! God does crazy things! Check your Old Testament.	Hey, Dad.
Hey Bart... I mean, Jesus. Hey son, you want Flanders to kill anybody? Hes totally in my power.	Well... theres a tall boy in front of me in class so I cant see the board.
And I sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!	Yeah!
All strapped in?	Yep.
Bart, you wanna see something cool?	Oh, did you pick that big scab off your knee?
My science fair project proves that an asteroid will strike the earth on July 15, 9789.	Who cares? Ill be President of Hell by then.
Fine. Good luck with your project, which Im sure you havent started yet.	Ill tell you my project a fisteroid hitting the planet nerd.
Thats pathetic.	Jeez, I put a lot of time in this. Back to the drawing board.
Hey Bart, is your cootie shot ready?	No, the science fairs not till next week!
I really need that shot. My dog and I accidentally touched tongues.	How is it accidentally when this is the fifth time?
Bart, isnt that awfully similar to the cootie patch you did last year?	That was preventative, this is morning-after... eh, youre right.
That was preventative, this is morning-after... eh, youre right.	What am I gonna do? Good ideas dont grow on trees.
What am I gonna do? Good ideas dont grow on trees.	Or do they?
Thats not very attractive though.	Not really -- I was trying to bounce it off your left testie.
Testis, my friend.	Look, I need help with my science fair project.
Look, I need help with my science fair project.	To sweeten the deal, Ill pick you first for basketball.
Bart, I fail to see the scientific function of this Homer Humiliator youve devised.	Well, we gotta come up with something. Hey, what if we make some kind of robo-pet?
A robo-pet? Not a bad idea. Bully, Bart. Bully!	Where? Is it Nelson?
Research shows its impossible to gaze at a baby seal and say anything but...	Awww.
First Place goes to Bart Simpson and Martin Prince...	Yeah!
Wow! While I was sitting here feeling sorry for myself, Barts invention actually changed someones life!	And best of all I got funding for my Homer Humiliator.
So, partner, whats next on the agenda?	Oh... um...
Back off, man. Cant you see youre embarrassing Bart?	When did you take that picture?
And check these out...	VIP passes!
Wow, video games sure have changed since I was a kid. How many points does it take to get an extra life these days, son? Thirty thousand? Certainly not fifty.	Games dont have lives or points anymore, Dad.
I wont shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.	Whoa! Guts Of War Two Entrails Of Intestinox!
Whoa! Guts Of War Two Entrails Of Intestinox!	Colon smash! / Rectum kill!
Weve made a game thatll reward the hardcore gamer with hundreds and hundreds of hours of--	Finished it.
But, working on this game cost me my marriage! I, I have twins Ive never met!	Well when you meet them, tell them your games too easy.
Man, how many quarters does this game take?	Dad! Funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in Hall G!
You kids have had a big day. Head up to the tub while I deflate your toys.	Save us, Fun Dad!
Yay! / X-Games! X-Games! / Alright!	That isnt an X, Mom.
Oh no, Games stands for Gathering of American Messengers for Evangelical Sports!	Sports?
Im sorry, gang. I blew it.	I hate it when grown-ups call kids gang.
Why do old squirrels always crawl into my engine to die? Guess well be making an unscheduled pit stop, gang.	Were not a gang! Gangs are cool!
Relax, Mom -- be adventurous.	Yeah, just have fun -- Dad would.
Holy casserole-y! Thats good gloop!	Whoa, spicy! I wish I lived in Ethiopia!
Goorsha!	Goorsha!
Oh no, I dont eat anything new unless Ive eaten it before!	Aw, come on, Dad, be a foodie! Youre already a fatty and a drunkie!
What kind of American man doesnt want to explore global food culture?	And then brag about it on the internet!
People are loving our list of Springfields top ninety-nine Afghan restaurants.	I feel bad for all those places that didnt make the cut.
Uh, kids... dont forget about our special plans Saturday night.	Oh sorry, Dad. Our blog is so popular, we got an invitation to the most exclusive restaurant in town. Kent Brockman himself could only get a reservation at five-thirty or nine-thirty!
Pine needle... sorbet... Pine needle sorbet!! My kids do not eat sorbet, they eat sherbet, and they pronounce it sherbert and they wish it was ice cream!	Sorry, Dad -- this is our thing now.
Kids, I was thinking... was it really such a great idea to invite your father to that dinner?	Relax -- Dad will be the life of the party. Hell be the fourth Mouth-keteer.
And now... pork chops one hundred ways!	A hundred pork chops!
Wow Mom, that was awesome!	We ate mad-scientist food and broke up a meth lab in the same day!
We ate mad-scientist food and broke up a meth lab in the same day!	Fun Mom! Fun Mom! Fun Mom!
Ooo kids, did you hear that lesson?	How is that the lesson? The point of the dinosaurs is no matter what we do an asteroids gonna wipe us out. So we should party hard and wreck the place.
All right, you can each have one toy.	Lisa has a big toy! No fair! That means I get two small toys!
No fair! This isnt big, its medium!	No fair, then I get four small toys and Lisa gets one medium and one small.
NO FAIR!	Choke on fossil poop!
A million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.	I like the beat -- play me the tune.
Were taking down kids who read.	Chapter-book crowd? Thats a juicy peach, but whats the cream?
Im putting together a tween-lit gang-write.	Tween-lit gang-write?
Tween-lit gang-write. But this Babar needs a Zephyr.	A Zephyr?
Youre the Zephyr.	This better not turn out like Kansas City.
Your friends are lookin at my bloomers -- wash em again!	With your share of the money, you could get your own studio apartment...
Well, I dont like to brag about it, but I did publish five modestly successful childrens books.	All we need now is a computer guy...
Youre group-writing a book?! But the only reason anyone would ever do that is... profit!	Like no one ever writes for money, Lisa. I dont see your boyfriend William Shakespeare missing too many meals.
Hey, this jobs fallin apart! Everyone head for a different airport and we meet in Rio in a year with new faces!	No ones goin anywhere. Okay, the vampire genre is sucked out. All we gotta do is find a new monster to be our hero.
The first part is always green, but it turns red.	A troll, thats it! Our book could be about an orphan troll!
The king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?	Okay, Gaiman, youre in. Your job is to get lunch. And lose the British accent.
...and so, Lucinda placed the fifth shard in the stained-glass window, which now clearly read your parents are alive. Gregor turned to his twin sister and they both understood their journey was just beginning. The end.	Its good. Weekly Reader Star Selection good.
Im so proud of us.	Oh, you didnt write any of it!
Yeah, only your professional-strength output tray can handle the weight of our manuscript.	Correction finished manuscript.
But we have a problem here. Wheres your fake author?	Fake author?
That was Gaimans job! Lets acid melt him in a bathtub!	Okay, stay frosty! All we need to do is find some sap to pretend to be the writer of our book. So hit the floor and find some pathetic wanna-be author!
So, does this square us for Kansas City?	Square as Golden Books, Pop.
What happened to me? In one vulnerable moment I became the thing I hated most -- a literary fraud.	But Lis, when this book comes out, youll be beloved! Not just by Milhouses, youll get attention from Jacksons, Xanders -- even Aidens!
Yeah! / Lets get em! / Oh yes! / Hes right!	Rule number one of book heists never fall in love with the book. We queer the deal -- we lose the money!
Bart, remember the thousand-year war between the trolls and the ogres?	Yeah?
Now its a dance contest at the vampire prom.	Lets steal back our book.
Somewhere in that building is a computer with their sucky version of our masterpiece.	The book prints at midnight. So if we swap in the original version , theyll print the wrong book -- our book.
Good evening, gentlemen.	Kansas City.
Someone in your gang tipped me off to your little caper.	A traitor?
Well, we may have lost, but we gave the bad guy a laugh -- thats something.	Our book! The real one!
Maybe watching your bride coming down the aisle.	Hmmm.
All you have to do is write me a letter about how hip and influential your parents are.	Milhouse, Im gonna win that thing.
Homer, were here to throw the most redonkulous marketing outreach this towns ever seen. All you have to do is invite every cool person you know.	Hey, I wrote the application. Do any of my friends get to come?
And thats why John Gielgud is more of a father to me than my own father!	Wheres the nachos you promised?
Oh sorry, sweetie. Bart can read it to you.	Read to Lisa? Why dont you just ask me to kiss her?
If you kissed her that would be lovely.	Ill read! Ill read!
Proceed to the page with the butterfly bookmark as I cuddle up with Madame Bunny.	If genn-i-oos--
Genius.	...is eternal pati... pat-eh... pa-tie...
Patience! Patience! Get on with it!	Shut up! Shut up! Im a bad reader, okay?!
Well, I could help you...	I dont want your help! Ill get one of those jobs where you dont need to read, like French fry maker or general.
Well, youre getting my help.	Forget it.
Dont you want to be able to read the things people carve into your chest in prison?	I guess.
We did it, Bart! Im a mentor!	Big deal. You taught me to read one book.
No Bart! You can read other books too!	What?!
Little Women? Are you aware thats another way of saying girls?	Look, I had to read it to my sister.
Yeah. Poke-ahontas and Sock-ajawea!	Nice save.
Get reading!	...and Amy and Jo hugged one another close, and everything was forgotten in one hearty kiss. End of chapter eight.
Does Amy get over her conceitedness?	Aw, come on, guys, its getting dark.
Mo-om, what are you doing?	What a rip.
Its closing?! But where will people find clips of old TV shows if theyre not housed in a giant building? Where? Where?	Ay carumba!
Hm, theyre selling off all the old TV relics.	Whoa! The gun Sheriff Baby wore! Hm.
Fatso Flanagan!	Whos Fatso Flanagan?
Wow, thats good bloat work.	He always comes back really religious.
I liked the knowledgeable docents.	I like the early closing time.
I dont know if Ive got it in me.	Well, people also love a quitter... Sarah Palin... The Beatles...
I know that laugh! Its the laugh of the most ungrateful, credit-grabbing, other-peoples-room-service-eating man that I ever met! I will never forgive you for what you did to me!	Krusty, you know her?
I dont find those funny, just frustrating.	Theyre pretty funny. Once I used one on Milhouse. He was wishing for his parents to get back together, but the flame never went out.
Im Santa?! Now Ill never die.	Cant we just send out a picture of the pets dressed like reindeer?
Um... who says were gonna have kids of our own?	Not me, man. This cycle of jerks has to end.
I found it quite normal. Anyway, if youre looking for your Dad. He took the kids to see his Dad.	Thanks.
Finally. The only thing I wait in lines this long for are for slightly-better cell phones.	Why do we even have to go to this stupid wedding?
Dont argue in front of the airport line. Strangers are judging our marriage!	Lisa, do you really need all these Kurt Vonnegut novels?
Yes, but I never use that kind of toothpaste!	We dont need dental floss either, Mom.
Looks like were back to traveling on tramp steamers and produce trucks.	I call shotgun!
Its too early to call shotgun!	Its never too early to call shotgun!
Im still gonna make my flight, right? Cause if not, you have to put me up in a first class hotel... thats how it works. I...	Fatso Goes Nutso! And post to YouTube with the following key words fat, stupid, classic Simpsons, and, just to be safe, baby rides kitten rides penguin.
Fatso Goes Nutso! And post to YouTube with the following key words fat, stupid, classic Simpsons, and, just to be safe, baby rides kitten rides penguin.	Perfect.
Dad, you out-talked the talking heads!	From now on when someone asks me, Im gonna say you are my father.
This is going so great. Im already a Halloween mask.	Thats not you. They just painted Shrek yellow.
Youre endorsing Ted Nugent for President?! Hes a right-wing rock star who likes everything I hate!	Could there be anyone awesomer?
No question about it.	I love that guy.
It wasnt just her, Homie. It was all of us.	I did it just to mess with your mind.
Leave her alone! Thats my only talking daughter!	Lethal inject her on the electric chair!
Bart, its okay to say that at home, but not in court! Take it back!	Withdrawn.
I have a Drippin Dots for breakfast every morning, at lunch I get a massage in front of strangers, and then I spend the afternoon browsing cell-phone skins.	Ever get tired of those dancing waters?
Yo, Bart dude. Can I get a ride to the food court?	Hop on!
Id have more friends if I knew what people liked. But I wont know what people like unless Im their friend. Its a conundrum.	Helpful hint if you want friends, dont use words like conundrum.
Helpful hint if you want friends, dont use words like conundrum.	Jimbo heard me say it. Im dead.
All my friends have birthdays this year!	I just un-friended Skinner!
I have a thousand friends! And only eight of them are Milhouse.	A thousand kids?! If you could get each of them to send you a dollar youd be a millionaire!
Thanks for SpringFacing me your head cleaver, Bart.	Check this out. Im hiding a bomb in this pile of corpses, so when Kearney loots their ammo, he gets a face full of ass shrapnel.
Yknow something, Bart? Im getting tired of things like that.	Tired of what? I dump on you, and you take it -- thats how friendship works.
Taxi!	What gives? Hes not crawlin back.
Milhouse!	Milhouse!
What is it, Bart?	Listen, um... after our fight, I couldnt sleep.
Well, I was doing fine. Warm glass of milk, some choice cuts from The Wriggles and I was out.	Cmon, man. At least listen to what I have to say.
Okayyy...	Um... well... this is usually the part where you say youre sorry.
Bart, Im not your puppet.	I know, I made you into a real boy last week.
Thats perfect!	Wait. What? No!
Gee, Bart. You seem, uh, how can I put it? Milhousey.	Really? Its not that bad, is it?
Bart, youll never learn.	Milhouse, youre the closest thing I have to a brother. A brother with the wisdom of an older sister. And thats why we squabble, cause families always do. But in the end, theyre still a family. What do you say... brother?
I want something that comes from you, Bart. Were done here.	But-but-but...
Oxygen... I need oxygen.	Cmon, man. A few more balloons and thisll look really awesome.
Milhouse.	Ive been out here all night, man. Just let me know what itll take for you to forgive me.
Can I punch you?	Sure.
Can I... have someone else punch you?	Sure, whatve you got? Puppy Goo-Goo comin my way?
Sure, whatve you got? Puppy Goo-Goo comin my way?	Ay carumba!
Im glad its over. I wasnt comfortable having the upper hand.	From now on Ill dominate you... in ways you dont realize.
Howd you get so many more Valentines? I got one from Lisa and one from my optometrist.	Thats a bill.
No! Its got a love stamp!	Maybe we should just watch TV.
Its a beautiful afternoon. No TV.	Luckily, she doesnt know that our viewing platforms are... multi.
Hey, Bart, why dont we become MythCrackers? I bet those guys get so many valentines.	That might be a good idea, but then again, you thought it up. Eh, why not?
Did you invent a robot hand to touch the buttons?	Something like that.
Something like that.	Ladies and gentlemen, that myth is... cracked!
Cool, now my beauty will be on the outside.	Hes still inside-in, folks! And just to prove it
The one day the lunch-lady decides to wash her hands...	Okay. That was the last school myth and its officially... cracked.
So school is just... everything we see? Thats sad, man.	You into cigars now?
Its a Twix.	I cant be the guy who killed everybodys fun. Thats Skinners job.
American Girl doll day? You might be surprised at the number of boys who have American Girl dolls. Its not weird cause theyre historic figures.	I have found one last myth to destroy -- the so-called legend of Groundskeeper Were-Willie.
I have found one last myth to destroy -- the so-called legend of Groundskeeper Were-Willie.	Prepare to be disappointed!
All right, whos the wisenheimer thats been eating the powdered food?	Not me.
Boy, I told you an hour ago. Stop that!	But Bunkerball is keeping us sane!
Do we really have to sit here the whole time? I mean, if we went out now, it might be cool to see the town empty.	Yeah! I could sneak into the school and write whatever I want on the chalkboard!
Why are all those cars parked at City Hall?	Ay carumba!
Please. Put that down.	I just got started!
Eh, Im sick of watching Fox. Lets get some fresh air. I got the ATVs right out back.	Should I get my helmet?
Springfield talk!	Well how are we supposed to get fuel?
Its not perfect here, but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind, Wikileaks is right over there.	Howre you doin, Mr. Assange?
Hey baby, banned forever doesnt mean you cant go back sometimes.	Yes it does.
Well, Ive tightened the bolt! I think were good!	You sure this is a good idea?
Im sure someone will come back to tell me where they went. If I go inside they might not find me.	Come on, man, we wouldnt leave you behind.
Ow!	Accident! Here comes another one!
Man, oh man, look at this place! Finally, a supermarket with a clear premise island something.	Its like going to Hawaii without the murderous locals!
Ooh! An apron with a sonnet!	Open mine! Quick, before it suffocates!
A bunny! Just like the one I had when I was a girl! How did you know?	Check it out! Its on TV!
No refunds.	I saw this picture at Grandmas house, then I hit the pet stores till I found one that looked just like it.
Aw... I mean arrrgh!	Aw, hes trying to eat ewectwicity.
Why you little... Im gonna get... No, Homer. You cant strangle a boy on his mothers birthday. Juries hate that. So instead, boy, I want you to... get in that rabbit cage!	No way, man! Im a free-range kid!
Ive been thinking. I really shouldnt have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. So Im gonna let you out with my apologies.	Dont wanna come out.
What?	I like it in the cage. These cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.
Boy, get out of that cage!	But its my home now, sir.
Awesome revenge -- cutting your Dads face out of a piece of cardboard!	No, you dweeb. Its a stencil. Im gonna take Homers ugly face and spread it all over town.
Can I come? Every vandalism spree needs an obnoxious laugher.	Youre in.
Heard about this thing, boy?	No, no, Im too concerned with unemployment.
Yo, mysterious pranksters, its time for dinner.	Dammit, she knows! Okay, how do we buy your silence?
Just throw in a couple of fur is murders.	How is fur murder? Theyre just animals.
Da-ad!	Fine. Furs murder. Everythings murder.
Bart, youve really grown as an artist.	Thanks, Milhouse. We make a great team.
Hold it right there!	The jerk in the glasses did everything!
Im Shepard Fairey.	What was that name again?
Im the guy who created the Obama Hope poster, and the Obey stickers.	Man, youre the talkiest bullies I ever met.
Were not bullies, were artists. And so are you. Urban vandalism is now the hottest art form there is.	Hey, I got an F in art. Mainly so it would say fart on my report card.
Bart, we would love to set up a gallery show for your street art.	Well, if its in a Gallery, how is it street art?
Bart, street art is not about questioning authority.	Well, Ill have to discuss it with my partner.
Bart, say yes! At the opening, I could wear a sports jacket with a t-shirt and jeans!	First, Im not sure you have the shoulders for it, and second, maybe weve pushed this far enough.
I put you in a rabbit cage! I poked your flab back in! Square by square!	Count me in.
Look at me, Im Mr. Fatso! Its funny cause its so preposterous.	Yeah.
Weve hit the big time!	I carumba? Not so loud! If my Dad hears about the show, he might realize Mr. Fatso is him!
And a great excuse for me to bust out my courtroom jacket.	Thanks guys, I um... huh, this collars feelin pretty tight.
Thanks guys, I um... huh, this collars feelin pretty tight.	Help! Helllp!
Help! Helllp!	Oh, this is just a dream. All I have to do is wake up.
Well, we do.	I wanna show you I understand how you feel. And they say a pictures worth a thousand words
You just ruined my car.	Correction. Its worth ten times as much.
Five hundred dollars? Woo-hoo! Thanks, boy.	Youre welcome. And from now on, Dad, if anyone laughs at you, theyve gotta go through me.
Really, anyone? What about the Hulk riding a rhinoceros? Would you stop him from laughing?	Wait, is the Hulk laughing, or the rhinoceros?
Both, but the rhinoceros doesnt know why. Hes just trying to fit in.	Dad, its getting cold out here.
Dad, its getting cold out here.	Art lovers and Bart lovers! First of all, Id like to thank the good folks at Springfield Arts Daily for setting this up.
Yes... yes. Yes.	As a graffiti artist, therere so many people to thank... people who build walls... nighttime, for being dark...
Bart Simpson, youre under arrest for tagging the town. This overdue art-quake that taught us all a new way of seeing was actually a police department sting!	It was?
Chief, I believe I have the answer in the back of my car.	There you go.. thanks for comin out...
There you go.. thanks for comin out...	I need to go to the bathroom.
More angry texts from work!	Thats a lotta eights!
Thats a lotta eights!	I cant believe you got all your friends in trouble, and you got the day off!
Hey, its called karma.	Isnt karma where if you do something bad, bad things happen to you?
You stupid...	Whats goin on? Is this a joke?
Hey, guys! Whatcha doing in my dream?	Trying to fix your broken brain.
Listen, everyone! We should fall asleep in this dream! One minute at this level equals two hours one dream level below!	Wait, dreams have rules?
Everything has rules, Bart.	Not me when I hit the dance floor!
Forsooth, a mystry-	In your dreams!
In this place mothers are for drunk driving!	Hey Dad, if this is your fantasy world, how come Flanders is here?
You left him because I tipped the boat over and ruined the vacation!	Pathetic. A kid who cant keep his parents marriage together is no kid at all.
Well... I didnt really feel like going to Moes today... thought I might hang out here for as long as I can take it.	Company physical coming up, huh?
I aint payin! Two of my shortbreads were broken!	Hey, check it out! Lennys hit a new low!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!!	Hey Dad, can we play?
Axels to axels, rust to rust, amen.	Amen.
Dearly beloved, we are not here to mourn their deactivation, but to celebrate their period of function.	Can I hollow out this ones head and use it as a turtle tank?
Ooo, heres one Happy Little Elves Two The Sequelf. Two kids.	That movies for babies.
How was Crappy Little Elves?	My friend and I only see it to rank on it.
My friend and I only see it to rank on it.	Get that stuff off!
Take a picture first.	Now!
Ill do anything for free beans. Anything.	Hey, nametag! Do you know who her boyfriend is? Jimbo Jones!
Corn, flour, corn, corn, no gluten, corn, two stuck together?! Now Ive gotta fill out a form.	Listen lady, you do not two-time the man with the skull t-shirt.
Jimbo doesnt care about me -- he didnt even notice my side braid!	Oh, that is cool. Looks like two snakes trying to kill each other on your head.
Thats what I was going for! You know, for a second grader, youre pretty sharp.	Im actually in fourth grade, but I read at a second grade level. They think I might have a problem.
Not so fast, Simpson. F.Y.I., you got another date tomorrow with Shauna.	Why cant you do it?
Bart and Ill figure out something.	Yeah.
Lets go! And dont look guilty.	Huh?
If anything happens to her Ill beat you up from inside your brain.	I stole this...
You stole perfume?	Uh, yeah, me. I use it all the time.
Uh, yeah, me. I use it all the time.	MI-MI-MI-MI-MI...
YOU-YOU-YOU-YOU and I are taking a trip to mall jail.	Isnt that what used to be the Beanie Baby store?
This is so cool. You took a fall for me. No ones done anything for me before. Uh-oh.	Dont worry. I made sure he cant get too far.
Bart, heres my thank-you gift.	What could a girl have that I--
More breast?	No!
Im offerin ya a chicken breast, ya boob!	Doesnt anyone here realize Im only ten years old?
Bart, no dinner means no dessert.	Im just not ready for cookies!
So, what do you want to do now?	What any boy would push you in a puddle and run away.
Maybe I should be faithful to Jimbo. Hes bought me a lot of gum over the past couple months.	Listen... I could get wedgied for this, but Jimbos a jerk. You can do better.
Well, who wears a wool hat to a pool?	Its not fair! You know thats hilarious!
Hey, no running on the deck!	Im on the grass apron!
Hey, Bart.	Oh, its you.
Why do men always think with their tongue? I came to help you.	Then go back to Jimbo and show him every boob youve got.
But you told me he was a jerk and that I could do better!	All right. Follow me, to a place where nerds, dorks and dweebs can gather in safety.
This isnt, like, some creepy place under an off-ramp?	Okay, well go to my second choice.
Well be right there.	Youre a bully?
Now its time to talk about what Carl wants.	Man, they have every entrance covered. Youd have to be a Navy Seal to get in or out.
Hello, lovebirds.	What are you doing here?
Your older sisters right, Bart.	You dont want me?
I wanna find out who I am. And thats something only an inappropriately older man can tell me.	Well, that is one lucky creepy guy.
Well...	Its okay, Dad. Hes just putting the fear of God in me.
Royalty Cruises -- one week away from the everyday! Visuals of commercial, if anything, underplays the thrill of actual cruise experience.	Want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want!
Want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want!	WANT!
There is no Mrs. Steak. Who could stay married to such a man.	Okay... maybe I can pay for the cruise. Lets see how much it costs for a cabin on a low deck, no porthole, group Z lifeboat access... Its still a ton of money.
Okay... maybe I can pay for the cruise. Lets see how much it costs for a cabin on a low deck, no porthole, group Z lifeboat access... Its still a ton of money.	And theres a DVD library of movies that havent been released yet!
Just try to enjoy your dinner, sweetie.	I cant, I sold my dinner futures.
Homer!	Its okay. I dont have much of an appetite tonight. Im going to floor.
Its okay. I dont have much of an appetite tonight. Im going to floor.	Mooooom! Daaaaaad!

I woke up and the money jar was full! That means the devil accepted my bargain. Now to uphold my end of the deal!	Snowball II!
And I sold our good china.	Really?! But thats been in your family for generations...
I never even got to realize this jacket was too small.	Its weird to hear myself saying this, but... I love you guys. This is gonna be the best vacation ever!
And heres the worst part I never get any time alone with my wife because were all sleeping in the same room!	Look, thats our ship!
Oh, Im sorry, sir, but your cruise is over-booked.	What?!
What?!	I can offer you a cabin on our sugar-free fitness cruise...
No, honey. You just passed out when you saw the private bedroom in our triple upgrade!	I actually did it -- a perfect vacation!
Bon voyage!	Whoa, a fun schedule! Theres so much to do! Laser-Tag, Waterslide Bobsled Oh! Ice Cream Snowball Fight starts in five minutes!
Boy, thanks to you, were having fun -- before you were born fun.	Where did the ship stop again?
Any place is fun if youre there with Super Lips.	Im just glad everyone is having the best week of their lives.
ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN / HERE AT SEA WE DRINK AND FROLIC / BACK HOME THATS CALLED ALCOHOLIC / YOUR FUTURES UP BUT PARABOLIC / ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN!!!	The songs right! No matter how much fun I cram into this cruise...itll only last a week. Then its back to Mom and Dad fighting, Lisa moping, homework, bullies, and a lunchbag sandwich soggy with the sweat of a juice-box!
The songs right! No matter how much fun I cram into this cruise...itll only last a week. Then its back to Mom and Dad fighting, Lisa moping, homework, bullies, and a lunchbag sandwich soggy with the sweat of a juice-box!	After this cruise, for the rest of my life, its all downhill...
Haw-haw!	Why cant vacation last forever?!! Ive got to do something.
Theyre buyin it. Theyre buyin it!	Chillingly plausible indeed, Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal.
Chillingly plausible indeed, Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal.	Now to make sure no one can call home to check... with a little help from the make-your-own-sundae bar.
Oh no! Were stuck here!	Woo-hoo! Vacation forever!!!!!
Worthless, worthless, worthless...	What a load of crap!
Can I put my hand through you?	Hey guys! Can you believe how awesome this is? If it wasnt for this virus thing, wed all be back at our old sucky lives -- instead youre here, where you can be lovey-dovey all the time! Come on, kiss! Kiss!
You are so naÃ¯ve, Charles. We should rule them as conquerors!	Cant anybody enjoy their forever vacation!?
Bart, glad youre here. Were all gonna watch a movie together.	Yeah, a movie! It is about time you guys started havin some fun!
Bart, how could you?	Uhhhhh... gotta go!
Speak passenger, son of passenger.	It was all a hoax, theres no virus.
But the warning from the General!	That was just Treat Williams in a virus movie.
I take back everything I said to you that night in the dolphin lab!	All that happened is we got a little extra vacation, is that so bad!?
My booze and cologne!	Thats fair. Sorry. I deserve it. Ow, that one really hurt!
This stupid prank is the most selfish thing youve ever done!	I wasnt being selfish, I did it for you guys, too!
I wasnt being selfish, I did it for you guys, too!	Lisa, you made friends with kids just like you! Mom and Dad, you were more happy and in love than I ever saw you!
Lisa, you made friends with kids just like you! Mom and Dad, you were more happy and in love than I ever saw you!	It was the best week of all of our lives... and I wanted it to last forever.
Whoa. /	They spend all their time trying to raise a baby, and why? So it can grow up and do the same dumb thing on and on forever!
The penguins life isnt all bad. Those ones are having a blast!	But the slides just like our cruise! A short awesome thing that just shows you how boring the rest of your life is!
Haw haw.	Stupid Nelson! I hate that guy.
No, this is really good. I...	Nelson took my lunch money again!
Youre gonna be my breakfast English sausage.	Hmmm.
Simpson, you know why Im here.	Nelson, I could give you my lunch money... or, I could give you...
Lunch? Actual lunch?! Look at all them burgers and fries. I didnt know they served these things warm. They feel like a babys head.	I just thank God you didnt take my coupons. Got enough for a month.
Free hamburger?!	No, you give them the coupon and they give you the hamburger.
Thats Nelson!	No, youre imagining things.
I administer with this nose!	This is a happy ending?
Well, hes tough on nerds, but easy on the eyes.	Whatd you just say?
Well, I better get going -- this is startin to feel a little churchy.	Why do we have to audition for this stupid play and Dad gets to leave?
Maybe it was once, but now theres lots of better stories...	Krusty Versus the F.D.A....
Game Six of the 2011 World Series...	Hitler Mash-ups.
...And Lennys story about Cancun.	Yeah, why arent we doing Lennys story? That things hilarious.
Its disrespectful to call a grownup by their first name.	Yo, Homer! Mom says get your fat ass over to the Flanders!
Bart! Dont call me that!	Which one? Homer or fat ass?
Why you little... theyre both bad, and I suspect you know it!	/ Get your hands off of me, you fat ass--
Dice are Satans bones!	What the hey, Mrs. K.?
Thank God, a real kid.	Want my advice on dealing with the Hardly Boys?
Why do you care?	I dont. Im just bored watchin worms drown.
Okay. Whaddaya got?	Well, what youve gotta do is get them into the real world.
Especially when youre holding hands with your brother.	If you dont act now, when they grow up, people like me are gonna take all their money and girlfriends.
Bart, arent you gonna tell Mom and Dad about the problem you have?	Shut up!
Im just saying it wont get better unless you talk to an adult.	Maggie knows how to keep a secret. Why cant you?
Bart, just tell us the problem!	Im keeping a dolphin in my bathtub!
Thats my brother! Four years out of four.	Prank you! Prank you very much!
I fail to see the honor in this. Arent awards shows rather silly?	What?! Without awards shows, how would I know what movie has the best beheading, or that Glee is a comedy?
What?! Least Popular? I gotta go.	Hey, Dubya.
Whats wrong with her?	She just found out no one likes her. I thought she knew!
Lets see... Uncensored Jump-rope Chants... Oh, theres a whole thread labeled Lisa Simpson!	Ay carumba! Somebodys actually on your side!
Ay carumba! Somebodys actually on your side!	Lisa doesnt judge other people. Why should we judge her? Its signed, Truth Teller.
Forgive a fool her tears.	Hey Lis, some fifth graders are having a make-your-own pizza party at Flesh-In-The-Pan Pizza, and wanted me to invite you.
Fifth-graders? Ooh-la-la! They get to put their desks in a circle!	And read books where the parents are divorced. That joint is jumpin.
So, whens the party?	Lisa rocks, and so does her rock collection.
Thats mine!	This notebook is full of things Truth Teller said!
Give that back!	This one says post next Friday. Oh my God! Youre Truth Teller!
Let me explain. I have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if I give up hope. Now if you dont mind, and with all due worship, I would like to be alone.	Lady Gaga, meet your biggest threat Baby Googoo.
Truthfully, today there were no losers -- and no winners, since both finish lines were tangled up in this unholy mess.	I hear tapping from inside.
True love super-date.	Well, if you two ever get serious and have a baby, itll look something like this.
Oh brother. Lets dance.	Geek leak!
Okay, but you have to do your homework. Just kidding. Ive given up on that.	Just move your girdle, Yertel.
Just move your girdle, Yertel.	Hey Lis -- your dance partner just made the cover of Dorks Illustrated Magazine.
At least Im with someone who tries a little too hard because he really likes me.	Hey, plenty of babes have docked at Porto de Barto.
Yeah, for about a week. But as soon as they get to know the real you, they departo de Barto. And thats why youre alone tonight.	Oh my God, is that true?
Boy, if anyone needs me Ill be taking a popcorn bath. Its a thing I read about in a Mens Health magazine in a dream.	Dad, can I ask you a question? How did you ever get a woman like Mom to stay with you?
Pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle.	Is that the only reason?
You see? Hey, what are you looking at?	My ex-girlfriends.
My ex-girlfriends.	I cant believe she ran away. And this isnt helping.
I cant believe she ran away. And this isnt helping.	Id better switch to the hard stuff.
Observe. Hey, its me again. Hes there, isnt he? Well, I hope this doesnt sound weird, but Im inside your closet.	Um, thats awesome. But I think Ill visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me.
Shes pretty cute for Cletuss daughter.	Yeah, she got to drink milk as a kid instead of white paint.
Is you one of my kids?	No sir.
Prove it.	A, B, C...
All right, all right, youve convinced me, Einstein. What do you want?	Is Mary here?
Im afraid Mary done run off, we knows not where.	Dadgummit! Do you think she still likes me?
I dont know if we should be up here, Bart Simpson.	And why is that?
Cause the floor aint finished. Daddy just covers things with hay and says theyre done.	Mom, can we go to New York to find this girl I used to know?
...And five hundred dollars for Yankee tickets, which turn out to be bogus...	Well, dont buy em!
But theyre playing the Purple Sox!	Cmon, Dad. You love New York. Now that your two least-favorite buildings have been obliterated Old Penn Station and Shea Stadium.
Whats the matter, darling?	Were safe because you have to climb steps to get up here.
Son, you can dial down the crazy. Your mother and I talked about it and we found a way to get to New York. Its all set, boy. To save money, were swapping houses.	But dont the people wreck your house when they stay in it?
Fifty thousand square feet, huh? All Khlav Kalash! Used to be book store! Books.	Come on, lets go find Mary! This is the address her brother gave me.
Here we are! Anything you leave in the cab, youll never see again!	Hey!
Youve learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesnt exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. After that, its just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you cant get it together to leave. Ill get us some ice cream.	Thanks for asking, Duchess. Im sittin here waitin for a girl thats never gonna show up.
What makes you so sure?	Girls dont like me. I dont really like them yet either, but I think Im gonna. Theres a storm a-brewin down there.
Well, theres a girl a-standing right here! Its me, Mary!	Wow. What are you doin for money?
Aw, Im lying. My whole life here is a bunch of lies. Im just a writer with a performing option.	Lets talk about somethin else. Something nice.
So, Bart Simpson, did you really come all the way here just to see me?	Yeah... plus I thought I might get to see an air conditioner fall on someones head. But I guess that never really happens.
Give me some news of Springfield.	They let Sideshow Bob out of prison again.
They let Sideshow Bob out of prison again.	Huh. Didnt know they still ran those trains.
Hows your mama and your sister?	Trying to find high culture at low prices.
Well, without them around, you and I can walk through the city holding hands just like the men-folk do.	I could listen to your twang all day.
Would you care to hear it in song? Cause I wrote one... about you.	Can I do a rap in the middle of it?
I KINDA LIKED HIM WAY BACK WHEN / CHASED HIM ROUND THE LIVESTOCK PEN...	ROLLIN ON MY SKATEBOARD / PIMPIN LIKE A DRUG LORD...
Enjoy your fancy-schmancy in-house for the last time.	Um... Ive gotta go.
Go where?	Uh, well, since were here, Im gonna go try to get Al Rokers autograph.
Here you go, little fan. Killer storm on the way!	Um... Im gonna go try to sell this.
Boy, you tell me where Marys gone.	I cant.
Boy, you squeal like a piggy for the hillbilly man!	I cant, because Marys the girl that proves that girls can like me. And she wouldnt like me anymore if I gave her up. So I wont, even if you torture me like you do the English language.
Uh, shes somewhere in B-3.	Thanks, man.
But were here to ask if you have an idea for a couch gag.	The best submission will be animated and appear on the show!
No! For details, log onto thesimpsons.com.	Im submitting mine now.
And if anyone finds this footage after were all missing or dead, remember me as a hero.	Dad, you forgot to pick me up after Little League!
Dont act so surprised, Marge. You knew this day was coming!	Lets see what were dealin with here.
Cinnamon!	Yknow, its really not fair youre charging two hundred bucks for a comic that says twenty-five cents on the cover!
The only way to buy that comic book for twenty-five cents is to go back to nineteen seventy-four.	Thats impossible!
Thats impossible!	Or is it?
Allow me, gentlemen.	Its Homer! Before his boobs came in!
Hey, Homer.	Im your unwanted son from the future, who killed all your fun!
It was not love at first sight!	Ay carumba! If you guys dont get together... what does that mean for me in the future?
Ay carumba! If you guys dont get together... what does that mean for me in the future?	I dont exist?
I dont exist?	Or... my life might be a hell of a lot better!
Or... my life might be a hell of a lot better!	Maam, whatever you do, do not marry that ape.
Indeed! Which makes you Barty Ziff!	Oy carumba!
Whatever you say, little boy.	Give yourself a wedgie.
Ill get to it, Marge... Ill get to it... When we first got married, hed only take six months to do things...	Mom, how come you didnt do my homework last night?
Everyone relax. I think Ive got an emergency sinkhole kit in here somewhere.	Oh, man -- I gotta climb stairs? Forget it.
No one stays in the sinkhole!	Lousy surface dwellers...
...so just when my dad finishes his online degree in Sinkhole Engineering, they go and fill it in!	Are the credits transferable?
No.	That guy has a bone to pick with the Board of Regents. Hey, Lisas not getting on the bus.
Wheres she going?	I dont know. Dork farm? Who cares?
She never doesnt do what shes supposed to! This is major!	Fine. Well follow her.
Whats it say?	The five boxing wizards jump quickly? Whoa! My sisters finally become... mildly interesting!
Uh-oh! Do you hear that rattle?	I dont hear anything.
What a wonderful thought.	Boxing wizards. Boxing wizards. Whats she up to?
Lets settle this like adults. Wands down!	Maybe I should go on anti-psychotic meds.
Bart! What are you doing in my room?!	Lowering your blinds. Id hate for your carpet to fade.
Lowering your blinds. Id hate for your carpet to fade.	What are you doing Tuesdays and Thursdays after school?
What do you do Tuesdays and Thursdays after school?	Write stupid stuff on the chalkboard. And if you have any ideas, Im really running out. Todays was mousetraps are not slippers or something. Now what are you up to?
A gentleman doesnt ask and a lady doesnt tell.	Can I use that on the chalkboard?
I guess.	Gentleman doesnt ask, lady doesnt tell. Now all I need is one for Martin Luther King Day.
Hey, uh... hm... why dont we take the longer but nicer historic route? Then today will be nothing but beautiful memories.	Lisas going somewhere after school two days a week. And all we have are boxing wizards. If were gonna find out what Lisas up to, Ill need the help of all her old boyfriends.
Whatever it is, shes in over her head.	Way over. We gotta save that poor girl. Anyone know how we get home?
Are you playing poker with my college fund?	Im only down sixty-two dollars. Not counting my tips to the waitresses.
Get your hands off my future!	Fine, fine.
Yeah! Fifty dollars up! Time to play with house money!	Or, time to walk away from the table.
We can all hear you! Please log off!	Aw, cmon, Lis. No gambling story has a happy ending, except Seabiscuit. But you never hear about the ruined lives of the people who bet against him.
This is the worst thing thats ever happened to me! I was Ivy! Strong Ivy!	Oh man, this is priceless, but I cant keep it up. Youve still got a college fund.
What are you talking about?	Im Sideshow Bob!
Im Sideshow Bob!	Ive been using his avatar to play poker and trash his favorite restaurants on Yelp.
Ive been using his avatar to play poker and trash his favorite restaurants on Yelp.	And I saved your vegetarian bacon.
Oh my God! You won the pot? You must have nearly a million dollars! I can go to college and live like a Kennedy.	Listen... after I won, the website found out we were both under eighteen, so were back to the original five thousand.
Listen... after I won, the website found out we were both under eighteen, so were back to the original five thousand.	Did you give the money back to the people who lost it?
Cmon, tell me!	Because I actually like you and felt sorry for you.
What? You did?	Forget I said anything!
When I prayed for this concert to be over, I didnt mean like this!	I did.
Lisa, dinnertime!	LISA EATS BU-UGS...
Bart! I cant eat bugs anymore. Please, please, take my grasshoppers as far away as you can and release them into the wild.	Okay, but when I grow up and Im living on your couch, and I drink all your booze, and sell your jewelry, you gotta be cool.
Ill be cool.	But I will not be sharing my mini-fridge with Homer.
The bug!	I really think thats coming from our house.
That was four screams! Stupid A.F.I. Boy, never go into their Directors Training Program!	How bout the Disney Minority Program?
Now how would you qualify for that?	Im the son of an oaf.
Waters coming in the house, and weve got carpet mushrooms!	Dad, all the jury summons you buried in the back yard are coming back up!
Dogs cant get mumps.	Then you explain that.
Dad, check this out!	Dad, over here!
Dad, a mother giraffe is giving birth!	Dad, look, Im walking on the wall around the lion pit!
Dad, the baby giraffe is taking its first steps!	Dad, Im walking on my hands, and the lions think theyre gonna eat me!
Whoa.	Cool.
I did when I was uno.	Check out all these Sergeant Activity dolls!
No, thats Combat Jack, the original British doll that Sergeant Activity ripped off.	Fine. You have a weird old version of something. Lets just watch TV.
I didnt know that was an option.	I think Im done here. Lisa, go nuts.
Your father took you to a Korean gangster film festival?	Yeah it was great! This one guy was part of another guys gang, I mean kkangpae, but then he quit and joined another kkangpae, and when the guys in the first kkangpae found out, they were so mad they put his feet in a blender. Then they cut to a guy eating noodles and blood splashed on him!
I used to. Now Im into abandoned ethnic union halls.	Come on dude, this party rocks! Love the temporary tattoo station!
Dino-Cool. Oh, I get it -- a T-Rex for the T-Rex. How long did it take him to think of that one?	Hey! My dad worked really hard to make that. He took a class to learn denim painting!
This is so pathetic I cant even wear it ironically ironically.	No one bad-mouths my dad except me!
Oh ohhhh boy, oh oh oh oh boy, oh boy.	Have you been oh boy-ing all night?
O-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... We had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up.	Look. That kid threw your present in the garbage, and he called you a poser and everyone laughed!
He called me... a poser?	Yeah, I was sticking up for you.
Hey, better not attack me again -- my mom gave me a salvaged police whistle. We had to replace the ball but everything else is stock.	Ah relax, Im over it. Why arent you at the block party?
Block parties are lame.	Why do you think everythings lame?
I dont know... I dont get a lot of sleep. I was out really late at an all ages burlesque show. Sorry I was mean to your dad.	Thats okay, he is pretty lame. Hey... wanna watch TV?
Real TV? With commercials?	Terrible commercials!
But Im supposed to turn the compost!	Screw that, its Krusty time.
Hurry up! I want to get Grampa back here by three so we can get him and Maggie on the same nap schedule.	Ive labeled all his boxes!
Dad, I just noticed something youre not upset enough about this.	Hey, Lisas right. Youre the only one who hasnt cried about the dog.
Prep, prep, prep...	Dad, whyd you shut our dog in a cabinet?
Thats short for Rrright you are!	I dont think you even like Santas Little Helper!
Unfortunately, like all true stories, this one has a crappy ending.	You have a story with an ending?!
Thats a stupid idea. Holding cups are what thighs are for. Now, hang on tight!	Man, this story is filling in a lot of gaps.
Women and their crying...	Finish the damn story. Ive got a hockey game tonight.
And then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesnt make much sense except the Santa part.	Yeah, but at least it was short.
Homie?	Cmon, boy. Time to go to bed.
My dog.	All right, Homer. Its your moment. But hes mine tomorrow.
Is this a kid youd pay ransom for?	Dad, what would you do if you got my ear in the mail?
Feed it to the dog.	Youd have to wrap cheese around it.
I made it, kids! I am king of Learning-ton Castle!	We tricked you! / Eat Nerf, Homeboy!
Yeah, but Ill go home, weigh myself, and Ill have gained six pounds. Whats that about?	Hey, Dad. Are we going camping?
I guess an open garage isnt the best hiding place.	Whats up? Going crazy again?
So, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?	Guys who call themselves preacher or deacon are very bad. Water is money unless gasoline is money. And even though lots of things are razor-sharp, no one ever shaves.
Fridge-ra-torr!	Arent they just saying refrigerator?
Boy, get in the car. And say goodbye to your best friend forever.	Bye forever, Milhouse!
This is gonna be a lonnng apocalypse.	Ay carumba.
Ay carumba indeed.	Dad, how are we supposed to spend the rest of our lives here? Were already bored.
Heres something to pass the endless time. Write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations.	Yes, sir.
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom...	Oh God, now what?
Now were going to leave this place. Im sorry, Bart -- I know youve made a bug-out camp girlfriend...	Ive got to be honest with you. It was just a bag of rice I drew a face on.
White rice or brown?	I never noticed.
Everythings normal. The world didnt end.	Dad, you said people would be drinking each others blood.
Well Im glad youre not upset. All my extra credit points are like frequent flyer miles on a bankrupt airline.	Hey, dont blame me -- I didnt even take the test.
You didnt?! Is there no limit to your disrespect?	I had something better to do.
Bart, Im begging you to try and study.	When I think begging, I dont imagine someone standing up.
When I think begging, I dont imagine someone standing up.	Sorry, I cant grant a favor to someone I dont respect anymore.
You can spin in my chair!	Wheee!
Were cool, right boy?	Nothing a few George Washingtons wont solve.
Do it, man, or youll never see us again.	Principal Skinner, could you help me sharpen this pencil?
Well, I guess a little circular grinding might relax me.	I cant do this. Im not ready.
You really didnt study?	Well, I slept on my books, so I might have gotten something through osmosis.
So you know what osmosis is!	Uh... pajamas?
Our entire school riding on that coffee can head of yours. Weve got to get you more time to study. But how?	Pull the fire alarm. Id do it, but everyones lookin at me.
Children, remain calm... find your disaster buddy... which is different from your lab partner, but may be the same as your lunchroom buddy.	Well, well, well.
Well, well, well.	Looks like Mr. Vanilla just grew some chocolate chips.
I bought you time, boy. Dont blow it.	I wont. Im gonna ignore everything else on my schedule.
Pass this test and the eggs are on me.	They will be, Seymour. They will be.
So, hows the studying going?	When I start, Ill tell ya.
Youre letting your friends go hang because you are lazy, and selfish, and-- Hey, are you falling asleep just to spite me?!	Hey, why arent you eating that?
Something Stu forgot the music he loves!	Mrs. Krabappel? Are you a... teacher of the night?
I wish I was a hooker. No one in this town has any money. But the worst thing is whats happened to the school.	No, no!
Spinach farm, huh? Thats right, you talk in your sleep.	Lisa, I wanna pass that test, but I need your help.
Lisa, I wanna pass that test, but I need your help.	I have all sorts of problems lack of attention, Im afraid of ovals, I only know twenty-four letters... dont you fall asleep on me!
Look, the thing is, its more important to know how to take a test than knowing whats on it. So, do the ones you know first. If you dont know one, guess B and move on. Now, what is the capital of Massachusetts?	Uh... B?
I hear you, Seymour. Start the upswing!	The least common blood type is A--B, B--A, C--A.B., D--O. Doh!
Congratulations. You made it by one.	Thatll do, bug. Thatll do.
In this exciting strategy game, you amass resources -- timber, salt fish, and wax -- to fund a syndicate to gain influence with the Doges of Venice.	Doges?! Why do we have to play this stupid game Lisa likes?
Twister!	No! Whenever we play that, my elbow touches Dads junk.
It was so scary thinking something might happen to you guys.	Mom, I am so glad youre alive.
Were you worried about me, boy?	Sure, why not?
Clearly the boys in shock.	Oh yeah, Im a wreck.
Stop being blasÃ©!	Never!
Where are we going?	And why are we wearing our good clothes?
Kids, theres nothing to worry about...but were looking at replacements for your Mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family.	Oh, I see. You guys are trying to find a couple of saps to take us when dad has a coronary in the dead of night, rolls over, and crushes mom.
This is a pretty important decision.	How bout asking that Japanese guy who set the world record for eating hot dogs? Hes like a successful version of dad.
Yo. Im Mav.	Wow, a mans stomach can be flat?
This is so fast... its so hard to get to know a child after just one day I...	All you need to know is Im a politeness monster who eats please and farts thank yous. Maam.
Your father says I need to keep you lashed to the mast for five more arrrs.	Is that arrrs or hours?
It happens more than you know, Marge. Im a lawyer, hes a surfer, that combinations pretty unstoppable.	Well Im afraid that we dont want to be with anyone but Mom and whoever she chooses to be with.
Instead of concentrating on dying, were going to concentrate on living.	If you call this living.
Whos that stickin a fuzzy-wuzzy down my back?	Mary Spuckler!
Mary Spuckler!	I thought you left home to be a star.
Theres a lot of thirteen-year-olds out there with a voice and a dream. Only got work as a hand model.	Thats your hand?
Just the thumb. Did you miss me?	Get out of my face, cootie breath! I did miss you. You stink! Come over Saturday. Im gonna have to push you in the mud now.
Thank God I wore the underwear with the hole on the side.	Its eight in the morning!
Bart, when are we gonna do girl things, like catch a frog or leg wrestle?	Soon, baby, soon. Let me just kill Milhouses character. He thinks were on the same team.
Ask his girlfriend, the game.	Oh Mary, you know youre the coolest person Ive ever hung out with.
...but, Bart, I do know this you will not do better than Mary Spuckler, so dont ignore her for a stupid video game!	Hey, relax. She knows shes the apple of the corner of my eye.
Bart, do you mind if I call my mother?	Not at all.
Eight more payments and I own this. But are you sure there aint no video game youd rather be playin?	All eyes on you, baby.
I wrote a whole song for you, Bart Simpson! Least you could do is pay me full mind. I was gonna enter it in a competition.	Ay carumba!
Ay carumba!	Well youre gonna win, cause youve got star quality. Like the Hulk in movies other than The Hulk.
How can something that applies to Bart apply to me? Im so much older and wiser.	More like balder and wider.
Compliment her!	I dont know what she wants. What would my heroes say?
Bart, tell Mary to play the drums -- the only thing anyone listens to in any band.	Its hard to pick just one of those.
Bart Simpson, you get out of that gosh-darned fugue state this instant! Lift my spirits!	Um... lifting peoples spirits is an interesting topic. For centuries, Neanderthal and astronaut alike have enjoyed lifting spirits.
Bart? You wanna come with us? I need you.	Mary, weve just been through three hours of music. Usually, I only have music one hour a week, and the teacher spends it reading real estate listings for Fire Island.
Ill see you later, Bart.	Mary? Are you okay?
I brung you regrets from my sister. She has been de-avoidably untained.	Am I getting dumped?
Bart, I think its best if we take a break.	Good idea. I can chuck eggs at the other couples.
Just hug me, dummy.	Back pats?! This is a break up!
Bart, would you go to your room while your father and I finish our little talk?	Little talk? You guys are having a big fight! This is the problem with women! They dont say what they mean, until its too late!
Hand me my suitcase, boy.	When do I get a Krusty suitcase?
Ive told you a thousand times, call me Homer!	Whats this notice on the wall?
Standard hotel boilerplate. It just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.	Aw, man! We just missed it.
Oh, itll happen again, son.	Um, Ive gotta make a phone call.
HE WASNT SO SMART OR HANDSOME OR KIND...EVERY MOMENT WITH THAT BOY WAS TOTALLY HORRID / AND I CANT EVEN TELL WHERE HIS HAIR MEETS HIS FOREHEAD.	Why did I buy her that rhyming dictionary?
Thats it? Well, then lets power this party up!	SPUCKLER MARY, PLEASE FORGIVE ME / ALL I ASK IS ONE MORE CHANCE...
Love is more powerful than all my magic.	Hard to believe that country used to rule anything.
I WROTE THIS SONG TO SAY IM SORRY	DAD, DONT BE A CREDIT HOG
THE MELODY IS BY BEETHOVEN	NOT BAD FOR A MOVIE DOG.
Bart... youre a good duck, but we wouldnt last.	But Im the main guy in this story! Things are supposed to work out for me!
The Widow Mary Spuckler!	Woo hoo!
Well done, Bart. You played that like a combination of Willie Mays and Paul Cezanne.	Who are you?
You know, I played the ant in Antz. The lesser-known of the Ant movies.	Oh yeah!
While Bart turned out so wonderful in his own way!	Thats the way people talk about Ralph! Ralph, whose favorite color is peanut butter!
I wish I knew what happened...	Aooga... aooga... aooga...
Fine, no TV for twenty-four hours.	Twenty-four hours? Whered you pull that crazy number?
Wow, no TV for twenty-four hours. I couldnt get through a day without Doctors Oz, Phil, and Gupta.	Youre right, Im bored. Epoxy fight!
What the hell is an Epoxy fight?!	Dont worry, Ill clean it up. Get me some whipped cream and a safety scissors.
Dont worry, all I need is a cigarette lighter and some sandpaper.	All right, lets just use a razor.
Oh my God, you look just like your dad!	Lets see how far we can take this...
I always wanted to wear a necktie. Mom says they make you more--	Now sing the alphabet song!
Now sing the alphabet song!	What if we... Van Houten to the max?
Whoa! Thats a little too tight! Oh yeah!	Nah. Back to the sweet spot.
Nah. Back to the sweet spot.	Milhouse, if people believe youre a grownup, we could do anything.
Milhouse, if people believe youre a grownup, we could do anything.	Okay, first, tone it down. Time to teach you to be a man.
...and put the gas bill on... autopay.	Nice. Time for your final test.
I wish my Dad couldve been here to see my parents kiss.	Now, did you get Kirks license?
Uh-huh!	Ay carumba!
Youre the wussiest adult Ive ever seen.	Kirk, remember you have the super-powers of a middle-aged man.
Well, in my case my Mom was hit with a voodoo curse, I gestated for five years, then I popped out backwards and on fire.	Really?
Now what are you doing?	Just one sec Nelson gave me some notes on a prank Im doing.
Just one sec Nelson gave me some notes on a prank Im doing.	Now, I asked you here because I know a cool grownup who will take you to that club in the city.
Well, Milhouse, you might get past the bouncer at the jazz club because theyre in no position to turn anyone away. But it doesnt matter, cause we cant pay for the gas and the cover fee anyway.	Au contraire, starfish hair!
Au contraire, starfish hair!	The Baby Poindexter Company is being forced to pay a settlement to any parent who had enough misguided love to buy their videos.
Now remember, I cant sit backwards or I get sick.	Well, if I look at your face, I get sick.
Well, if I look at your face, I get sick.	Make me, baldy.
Your intellect-deadening DVDs turned my brothers brain to jelly.	Pretty shapes tell me to kill everybody.
Looks like youre entitled to the full rebate of nineteen ninety-five.	Thats all you pay for screwing up a child for life?
...lap pool and fully-equipped gym with eucalyptus towels. Now, let me give you the fourteen different apartment configurations The Hacienda, The Urban Oasis, Castle in the Sky, Connecticut Sunset...	Lady, my stomachs full and I wanna go. Thats how it works in this country.
Son, promise you will never look like me.	I sure hope not.
Feather boas?	Mines full of hand mirrors.
Why dont you put a personal ad on the internet? Thats how young people date these days.	Its weird that you dont consider yourself a young person.
Huh? What the heck are you talking about, Spectacles?	Grampa, you were the original bad boy!
Look at all this wrestling stuff.	Ay carumba!
Sorry, I been trying to forget those days for fifty years.	But Grampa...
But Grampa...	I wanna hear about old-time wrestling too.
I dont know. Should I really let the men who ruined my past and present hang out with the kid whos going to ruin my future?	Ill bring you home my dessert.
Folding chairs! Folding chairs! Cant hit somebody when theyre not looking without a folding chair!	Can I have one! Can I?
Why do you think bad guys are so cool?	Why do you still have a thing for Nelson?
Its so sad that Grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his God-given wrestling skills. What kind of person revels in disapproval?!	What kind of person, indeed?
I got one for just watching the game.	Listen, getting people riled up is what heels do!
No I dont. If you pray to Superman.	Well sure I am. I always thought Grampa was lame, but hes really awesome!
So, Beautiful, you got your moves memorized?	You know it, Glamorous. Eye gouge, ear bite, folding chair, hair pull, face-fart, flying face-fart, and then I start fighting dirty.
Beautiful Bart, can I have your autograph?	Sure, here you go.
Hey Bart, leave some of that bad attitude for the ring.	The world is my ring now.
Now entering the ring, the first family of foul play Glamorous Godfrey and Beautiful Bart!	You all stink!
And this is Laddie Liberty.	What are you doing?
I aint a heel no more -- Im a good guy... and youre a baby-face.	But, but, what about the cheating?
No more cheating.	And the preening?
No more preening.	But Im so pretty.
This is why we go to everything in this town -- it always pays off!	Honest Abe, can I pin him?
Damndest boos I ever heard.	Theyre cheering, Grampa.
I have a new student for your class.	Yo.
I just went to the bathroom for two minutes!	I know. Posted a video online.
Nice going, Bart. Youve ruined Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter. The legendary grand slam.	You guys, I swear I didnt do it.
Hand over your son, so we can administer Band Justice!	I know this looks bad. And I admit, I would totally lie in a second to Lisa or Mom or Dad. But I would never lie to Maggie.
I know this looks bad. And I admit, I would totally lie in a second to Lisa or Mom or Dad. But I would never lie to Maggie.	I did not do that prank.
I know someone who would make a great judge! Would you kids believe your Grampa once argued in front of the Supreme Court?	No.
I find that a little hard to believe.	Yeah, why would you play chess through the mail when you can play chess through the internet, or preferably, not play chess at all?
See here, sass mouth, youre not too big for me to tan your hide!	Its not a threat if I dont know what it means.
Ill fix your wagon!	Thanks, Id like that.
Thats exactly what George W. Bush said when he was inaugurated. People dont remember that.	This case is goin great. Although as usual, I look nothing like the courtroom artists drawing.
This case is goin great. Although as usual, I look nothing like the courtroom artists drawing.	Nice try, pop.
A civilian! She mustnt know Im a hero! Gouge her eyes out!	My wha?
Another mystery solved by Attorney General Janet Reno. Case dismissed!	You saved me, Lis! For the rest of my life, youll always be my one phone call.
Aw... but I do hope youll try to be good from now on.	Dont need to. Ive got you.
I think our lunches got mixed up.	Oh, Im sorry, that means I threw yours out. But I still have a couple of your mini carrots.
Oh, Im sorry, that means I threw yours out. But I still have a couple of your mini carrots.	Whats the matter? Not a vegetarian?
Tell ya what, babe. Why dont you get me a milk?	Milhouse, where are you going with this?
All right, get comfy.	Gentlemen, the fort is complete and will stand forever.
Funny how the brain does that, huh?	Its making me see them!
Probably one of Barts dirty friends! Boy, why are your friends so dirty?	Dunno. Why are your friends such drunks?
...debugged and fresh as a daisy.	Cool! They give you a bag of the bedbugs they killed.
Cool! They give you a bag of the bedbugs they killed.	Homers oatmeal, meet your raisins.
A high-voltage monkey prod? It is Krustys! He must have my dress. Lets go!	Whats the hurry?
Church bulletin? Church bulletin? Find out in whose loving memory this weeks service is. The answer may shock you.	Dad?! You always hated church!
Now, for the record, I hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. I never hated the church itself. And now, finally, I believe in something bigger than myself.	The only thing bigger than you, is you tomorrow.
DAY BY DAY... DAY BY DAY... THE DEACONS JOB... IS PRETTY OKAY... PRETTY OKAAAY... IM GOING TO BE A DEACON... DAY BY DAY... IM ALREADY A DEACON... DAY BY DAY...	Dad, the Oogle street cameras driving around town today. Wanna go moon it with me?
Church songs with clapping... I dont think this is what Martin Presbyluther had in mind when he founded our religion by sticking his Three Suggestions under the Popes windshield wiper.	Mr. Flanders? This new reverend has thrown tar in your half-pipe too?
I dont understand that on any level, but yes.	Well lets get Lovejoy back. Do you know where he is?
Hes in a place full of brimstone and exposed flesh.	You mean hes selling hot tubs?
Well, lets face it, I wasnt cut out for that job. Nobody listened. Look, the boys not even listening now.	Hes right, these underwater speakers are amazing!
God doesnt need Twitter to reach people. He uses leprosy and plagues.	Plagues...
Plagues...	Ew, locusts. Darkness, yawn. Bingo! Flanders, are you willing to get Lovejoy back by hook or by crook?
Neither! And I dont like it when other people rhyme!	Yes, but if I do something will you look the other way?
Yeah, but dont push it. Theres only so many times I can tell Nana its my birthday. Now whats this prank?	First, we got every dead bedbug in town.
To think those exterminators were just gonna throw these beauties away.	Now to leave a nice clean trail of bugs out of the swamp... the frogs follow... and Hoopers got a plague he cant handle.
Now to leave a nice clean trail of bugs out of the swamp... the frogs follow... and Hoopers got a plague he cant handle.	Ugh, one of these bedbugs is still alive!
Ugh, one of these bedbugs is still alive!	Ah, much better.
Fine. Ill just get rid of these Itchy and Mitchys.	For every one of my cartoons that you erase, I rip up a family vacation photo. And just so you know I mean business, heres an ear!
Hello?	Hi, Im looking for a Mister Ron -- first name Moe.
Check.	Mom and Dad still gone?
What about that snoopy girl reporter thats always hangin around?	You mean my sister?
The plot thickens.	Clueless little Lisa doesnt suspect a thing.
Bart, you said your grandfather wouldnt bother us!	I gave him a caramel. He should have been chewing for hours!
I dont wanna die! I wanna still be a burden!	Please be okay...
Please be okay...	HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE / HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE...
Boy?	Yes, Grampa!
Kiss my forehead.	Man, I must really love him.
Why am I in the basement? Shouldnt I see a medico? If the Wilsons calf is birthed, Doc Miller should be available.	Thank God your mental powers havent deteriorated.
Well, why the hell am I down here?	I was supposed to be in charge of you. I cant let Mom and Dad know what I did. But I promise Ill take good care of you until youre well again.
No deal! Im gettin outta here!	There, there, youll be fine. Ill take care of everything you need.
I want a foot rub!	Yes, but do you need one?
Every time I call Grampas phone, I get no answer.	Uh, he told me he was going to nap most of the week.
Time for your meds.	Go pink! Come on, pink! / Come on, blue! Come on, come on, come on, take it, take it, there you go, yes!
Go pink! Come on, pink! / Come on, blue! Come on, come on, come on, take it, take it, there you go, yes!	After a pulse-pounding race, hypertension pills win again!
Awww...	And Ive been wondering... not like I miss having my afternoons free or anything but... are you starting to feel better?
Absolutely not. My crotch is crotchety, sittin down makes me uppity, and you call these cups pleated?	Okay, okay! Just checking.
Without my magic suit, Im nothin.	Pass.
Except stand up.	Grampa, I made your favorite dinner -- teething biscuits soaked in buttermilk.
OH-OH-OH-OH-OHHH. THE PAIN! THE PAIN!	Youre completely fine! Ive been taking care of you, giving you love and attention... for nothing!
All right, boy, I admit it. Ive been faking being hurt. Just like I fake liking those terrible homemade Christmas gifts you give.	But Mom said it was a gift made with love.
Did she?	No. Even she thought it was crap.
But what you did wasnt for nothin. It was the best two weeks of this final, horrible part of my life.	Well... you are the first thing I took care of that didnt die.
Tattoo baby! / Walk away! / Tattoo baby! / Walk away!	TVs gotten so lousy.
Did you ever wonder if hippopotamuses think that rhinos are unicorns?	TVs not so bad.
Sweetie... did you ever think of doing something a little more creative with your time?	If youre worried about your Mothers Day present its in the works.
My dear boy, you undoubtedly think of the slide whistle as merely a whistle that slides. Let me disabuse you of that misperception.	Pass.
Do you have any idea how difficult--	Bye, now.
Behold! From the pages of Dune and Dune Messiah -- Gurney Hallecks beloved zither -- the baliset!	Pass.
So, you want lesson?	Yes... I want lesson.
Where you goin, Bart?	Piano lesson.
Clickety clack!	Wait, wait! Im not learning anything! Im just goin cause the teachers pretty.
Okay. But youd better steal bananas for all of us.	I willll!
Okay, lets try again.	That is so beautiful. Did you write it?
These are scales. Now, memorize. Every good Boris deserves farm.	Let me try.
Let me try.	Every good booger deserves flicking.
DLYA MAKIN	Whoopee...
Every note you play sounds like dying animal writhing on keys.	Awesome!
I just want to get more students and help my father with his dream -- driving a limo! He could tell big shots in the back that, no, they cannot smoke.	Seriously, Im gonna make you proud. I have hidden talents.
I am so proud. I wouldve been happy if Bart was just a piano mover.	Thank you. I owe it all to Zhenya.
Can you teach my monkey? Then I can deal with the Musicians Union instead of the Humane Society. Much easier to muscle.	Zhenya, I couldnt have done it without you. And you.
Bart, Ive never been so proud of you. Never, never, never!	And now Ill always be at home in a saloon!
Good to see you, my love. Sit on porch.	Are there other people in here?
Cmon. I gotta learn my moms stripper music by midnight!	If I got you all these students, shouldnt you be grateful?
I signed you up for the Ten-And-Below Talent Show next week!	You know, Im almost eleven, its not really fair.
Bart, when you were on that stage, it felt like you were pouring those notes right into my heart.	Hey, one of those notes could go to your brain and kill you. Are you sure you want to take that chance?
WHO CAN MAKE THE SUN RISE... Why wont anybody tell me?!	Im sorry! I was faking it!
Zhenya. / Oh, Zhenya. / Everyone knows Zhenya.	But theres really only one girl whose opinion matters to me. My Mom.
Id like to go home now. And to think youd do this on Mothers Day.	Is it too late to make you breakfast in bed?
Sweetie, youre just gonna be who you are.	Well, who am I?
You are unique, you are special, and at some point thats gonna come together and work for you. I know it.	Thanks, Mom. And that means no punishment, right?
Wrong. You have to walk all the way over to Grampa to take a plate of cookies I baked.	Heres your new plate, Grampa.
What the hell is that?	Its our favorite show!
Did she really say that?	Are you gonna walk upstairs and ask her?
You like this now? What about Planet Jackson and the Earth Brigade?	Dad! We dont watch that show anymore!
Samurai Shampoo Blast!	Ninja Throwing Soap!
No Karate Monsters in the bathtub!	Ki-Ya Karate Monsters!
Pill Attack!	Actual Sword Attack!
Were not broken!	Were broken.
Is it me or did this house just get classy?	Mom! Lisa made me break a lamp!
Orwell, obscure? The author of Animal Farm?	Grampa says he was a Commie.
Happy anniversary, Mom!	Our gift is us!
You think well last twenty-five years?	Nothing should.
Eat up.	The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
Thats not right.	Yes it is, theyre my lines as the scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz.
Poor guy.	Salt of the earth.
Well, what made you--	So many cookies will never be born...
Im glad youre back, Dad. Its hard to sleep with one un-kissed cheek.	Yeah, its tough being man of the house. You left some big underpants to fill. I didnt know they made Underoos in size fifty-two.
Theyre called Superoos, son. With pictures of the cast of The Expendables.	More like the Expandables!
More like the Expandables!	Why didnt you strangle me?
Bart! Why is the Dad I always wished for creeping me out?	Iunno. Cause youre incapable of experiencing joy?
Agent Crawford, F.B.I.	You guys know I dont talk to field agents. Get your boss on the phone.
Just rest on the sofa, Ill be home by ten.	Can we have some candy?
Then we heard a loud crash...we were tempted to scat...	And we looked and we saw him...
He pulled out bamfoozlers, and side-winding whizzles...	He laughed as he heard that old codgers house-sizzles.
Say, Mr. Hat, I dont mean to complain, but you promised us candy, not mayhem and pain.	The dude thought a while, then said
FLOOP-FLUFFLE-CIDE!	We had to escape from this behatted mammal...
A gumbamels a camel but faster and humbler. It doesnt take tips and its never a grumbler. So if you must leave in a kind of a scramble, then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel.	But if the gumbamel should ramble, then stumble, then just hop atop a Krustiferous Krumbull. But then if that Krumbull should happen to tumble, just call your amigo, the bee man of bumble.
Im frightened of nothing, not even Hell fires. Just dont let me ever be played by Mike Meyers.	So please do not worry, cause we did okay.
So please do not worry, cause we did okay.	Yes, kids will get candy, whatever you say.
Stupid kids!	Hey, if they get on an airbus, they know theyre taking their chances.
Nowhere to tie my kite... and I forgot my scarf.	Bingo!
Well, at least its a beautiful night.	Im alive! All patched up! End of story.
Actually, theres a little more.	Ay carumba!
I could do what I want to Barts head?	Aw geez. Strangle me out of this, Fatso.
Excellent, Lisa, A plus. Bart, your turn.	Well, my show and tell is that Im on Lisas body--
Bart, Lisa... Im afraid you two are going to be together for a long time. Why dont you try to say something good about each other?	Well... shes pretty healthy for someone whos been living with cooties.
Bart, arent Lisas ears clean?	Yeah, its like looking down a Canadian tunnel.
Rainbow... oh, Rainbow...	Not the pony dream again!
Not the pony dream again!	Hey, I did that!
Hey, I did that!	Yep, thats me. When shes asleep Im in control.
Yep, thats me. When shes asleep Im in control.	Lis, Im gonna make sure you stay asleep.
Why Bart? I thought we were friends!	A brother can never be friends with his sister!
Are you really, really sure?	Im afraid I am.
MOCK!	Yeah.
ING!	Yeah.
MOCK!	Yeah.
ING!	Yeah.
Oh my!	My pants, like the Lord, work in mysterious ways.
Sir, we are the New York Times.	Fifty percent attention-seeking, fifty percent to drop things on people.
Delete confirmed.	Okay Bart, be cool. Calm down. Youre not gonna die up here.
Here I am, slowly dying every day at five, six and eleven.	Help! Help!
Help! Help!	Child in danger with exciting visuals!
The movie Up has come horribly to life over Springfield. A local boy clings to life in a story that proves this reporters relevance!	Ay carumba!
Pray for a miracle, boy! God can hear you better from up there!	Dear Lord, please help me land safely, or transform this basket into a flying killer robot that I control with my mind, amen.
Thats not a prayer!	My God says it is!
No. For once, I wanna go first.	But Milhouse, I already let you push me on the swings.
And its an honor, but Im doin this!	Milhouse!
Milhouse!	Eat safety bar!
Why are we best friends?	Because your seat was behind mine!
I cannot imagine such a creature.	Hey, Homer. Did you just fart?
Did you just fart, sir.	Whatever.
Care to see a dessert menu? We have the best cobbler since Daniel Day-Lewis!	How much did this cost to restage?
Is Bart cheating?	Are the Popes tweets infallible?
Bart! Im gonna tell!	No, youre not. Because if you tell people I cheated, that means your system failed.
Oh my God, you found a loophole! Why dont you just put this much inventiveness into your work?	Because then Id be the one thing I swore I wouldnt you.
I know the answer. Im gonna force you to turn yourself in.	Good luck with that. The only thing thatll change my mind is a sign from God.
Well Bart, is that enough of a sign for ya?	All right, Ill turn myself in. Itll give me a chance to work some more on the detention quilt.
Did you know some historians think American football is based on an ancient Aztec game?	Its not American football, its just football!
Bart, youre not annoyed that Milhouse asked me to go to the American football game instead of you?	Mom, Lisas ruining football.
Have you kids seen your father? Surprised hes not here ogling these girls.	He said he was going to work.
Hey, oh oh oh! Now Maggie, we dont hurt each other in this family.	Are you nuts? You cant even kiss me goodnight without slicing me with your stubble.
Dad! Maggies rolling away!	Shes heading for Prairie Dog Village!
Im sorry, Homer Junior. Youll occupy an idealized place in my heart that no one can never quite fill.	Therapy, please.
Well, at least Im getting some attention.	And the best part is Im bombarding her with her own homework.
May I ask what this is regarding? Oooh, a budding new friendship? Oooh! Boy, how come you cant get a new friend?	Whats wrong with the one I got?
Im a non-observant Jew from Argentina.	Ay carumba!
Do you even know what that means?	Um... theres, theres a carumba in my eye?
Its the Spanish version of hot damn.	Ay carumba!
Now get up here, boy! Were gonna do the Super Bowl Shuffle.	No! You never let me be Mike Singletary!
MY NAME IS HOMER / IM A REAL FULL BACK / GONNA RUN THAT BALL / DONT WANT NO FLACK...	IF YOU TRY TO RUN / YOULL GET A HEART ATTACK...
Why you little--	HEY BIG MAN / DONT WANT NO TROUBLE / IM JUST HERE TO DO THE SUPER BOWL... SHUFFLE...
Cakey or gooey?	Mom, after six weeks, I figured out that Sensei Weinstein is really my psychiatrist.
Bart, I need you to help me win the election.	I can help, but its gonna get rough.
Im fine with rough.	You dont know what rough is.
You dont know what rough is.	That aint rough. More like a gentle breeze.
That aint rough. More like a gentle breeze.	Maggie hits harder.
Maggie hits harder.	Did the goodnight pixie just kiss my cheek?
Did the goodnight pixie just kiss my cheek?	Okay. You got my attention.
Okay. You got my attention.	You wanna win this election? Then from now on, you do exactly what I say.
You got it.	First go make me five pans of brownies.
Youre just taking advantage of the situation.	Maybe Isabel likes baking.
By discussing the schools budget crisis?	No, with balls to the head.
Organic gardening is an essential part of twenty-first century education, teaching both hands-on--	And what programs would you cut to pay for this precious garden of yours? The new whiffle-bats? Pizza Friday?
Not Pizza Friday! Sorry Lisa, you lose again.	You gotta get on your game, sister. You think Im tough? Wait till Gutierrez sinks her teeth into you.
You gotta get on your game, sister. You think Im tough? Wait till Gutierrez sinks her teeth into you.	Remember youve got an ace in the hole -- chocolate milk in the water fountains.
Thats impossible. Weve already had the best plumbers in the city look into it.	Hey, well worry about that after youre elected.
What are you so happy about?	Its in the bag, Lis. Once everybody sees this.
Its in the bag, Lis. Once everybody sees this.	Training wheels. She still uses training wheels. And watch this.
Leave the bottle.	I bet by the end of the night youre gonna look pretty good.
Hey. Im sorry I fired you.	No hard feelings. A lot of good things have been happening to me.
Children, I have some exciting news.	Were you thinking it?
Aooga!	Submerge! Periscope! Aooga! Aooga! Die, Nazi octopus, die!
Sweetie, about the submarine... whats your favorite food to eat when youre disappointed? Im going shopping tomorrow.	Ice cream sandwiches. Why?
What your mother is trying to say is we dont think you can be good that long.	Mom, is that true?
What your mother is trying to say is--	No, youre wrong! Youre all wrong!
Get real, ding dong! Youve already done so much bad stuff, Skinners never going to let you on that boat.	No, Skinner said I had a clean slate. So right now, Im as good as any other kid.
Good one, ding dong!	Mom!
Bart, sweetie, this is an opportunity for you to turn things around, yet again. And I believe in you. Yet again.	Thanks, Mom. Ill start by taking my plate to the dishwasher...wherever that is.
What are you doing?	To avoid temptation, Im getting rid of all the things that could get me in trouble at school. I buried all my whoopee cushions in the back yard.
What the?	Thats not where I buried them.
Buon compleanno, Squiduardo!	For what?
Off the list!	Firm but fair, sir.
Firm but fair, sir.	Dont want any troublemakers on our submarine.
Not bad, Simpson. Did you wash your knees?	Front and back, sir.
Aw man, five days without pranking. Im getting strange red marks.	But Im gonna make it.
Any of you kids got a triple A card?	What?! No! Ill be late! Skinner will cross my name off the list!
She heard me? Hello?	Hold for the President.
Always braggin about his fancy watchband. If only I could tell time.	Okay, I washed your car like you asked, I did your paper route, and Im sorry. I really am. This could be the turning point of my life. Where you, as a school guy, made a difference. What do you think? Can I go on that sub?
Hello, boy. At times like this theres not much you can say... especially if you dont know what happened...	Skinner didnt let me go.
Really? Hey, I bet that submarine isnt so fun anyway.	You think so?
It was just imaginary.	I know a kid should never turn to his father for help, but I got screwed. Is there anything you can do?
As I always say, dont get mad, get dinner. Then get even. With Skinner.	Youll really help me get revenge?
Yes. Whats Skinners weakness?	Everything.
Ill be right there! Just saying goodbye to mother! Seymour! Im going out for a walk! See you in several months at the soonest!	We have a problem, Seymour.
We have a problem, Seymour.	I did everything for you and you stabbed me in the back.
Take a look at this.	Shes in a better place.
Seymour! The cops are on their way!	Heres a bus ticket to Juarez and your fake I.D.
Oh, come on. I dont look anything like this... Dick Fiddler.	No you dont. Yet.
Dad?	Thanks for stickin up for me.
Someday I may have to fake my own death. And maybe you can help me with that.	Sure, Dad.
Dammit!	Ah geez, when did everything turn to crap?
Weve got a two-month-old. Are you sure you can handle her?	Just dont lose this claim ticket.
Oh! Are you with the Salvation Army?	What makes you think that?
What makes you think that?	Bless you.
The secret is dont read the comment cards.	Where do the people sit?
An Angelica Button wizard robe... with wand pocket!	And wand.
Professor Digglesbys wand! Now I have every wizarding stick from the Spells and Potions Department of Wagglepoofs Academy!	Dont make me learn about it.
Okay Bart, open your present. Its the one Im most excited about.	Plastic bubbling vomit... plastic bubbling vomit...
Plastic bubbling vomit... plastic bubbling vomit...	What?! Lis, youre smart. Why would you give me a book? Cause its easy to wrap?
Stop it, stop it! Why in the world would you burn a book?	Actually, the idea to do this came from a book.
Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury?	What? No, I got it from this.
How could you burn the present I gave you?	Because its my present! Did you give it to me because you thought Id like it or because you wanted to feel better about yourself?
All set.	Need directions, or a bottle of water?
No thanks, were fine.	Thank you sir!
Bart, you were right.	If you smell your farts in a dream, you die?
Get the twist?	Obviously.
Obviously.	Youre saying its from Maggie, but actually its from you. Thanks, Lis.
Youre saying its from Maggie, but actually its from you. Thanks, Lis.	Now why dont you donate that to whatever hopeless cause you want.
Ooo, date night! Ill go change my bra!	I wanna see Radioactive Man Re-Rises!
Illegally download it? Is that legal?	Who knows? But it sure is easy. Ill walk you through it. All you have to do is--
Wow, that was easy! All I had to do was click on--	And play!
Bless you, boy. That was the greatest thing Ive seen on a computer that I can talk about with you in the room. How did you know how to do that?	Im under thirty.
Theyre gonna take Dad! We gotta do something!	Im on it.
Its almost like having Dad here. Only with less growling when I go near his food.	I just want to know who dropped the dime on Dad. Lousy rat.
Maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.	Homer just pirated a movie. Its not the worst thing Dad ever did. Its not even the worst kind of pirate Dads ever been.
Yeah, and why dont they make a sequel to Taken where the Hangover guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is Fast and Furious.	Oh man, I would love to pirate that.
Will Smiths family wants to play your family.	Id be Jaden!
Wow! Midnight! I wont know which day to write in my diary.	Homer!
And miss the back half of Jimmy Kimmel? Thats when he experiments, boy.	You never watched an episode of Jimmy Kimmel in your life!
Hey, that actually feels good!	Oh yeah, more. A little bit more. Right there. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, thats the stuff!
Not to.	Well, no way Im giving a valentine to Nelson. Hes a bully, and I do not love him.
Jesus says to love your enemies.	Thats because Jesus knows one day he gets to look his enemies in the eye and say It was me who sent you to Hell.
Many of historys monsters never received a valentine Attila the Hun. Mao Tse Tung. And me, Will Lyman. This is Firstline.	Fine, Nelson gets a valentine. An old one from the box.
Fine, Nelson gets a valentine. An old one from the box.	Perfect. Bad movie, bad pun, even bad paper stock.
Dad! Barts on my side of the seat!	Da-ad! Lisas my little sister!
The rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...	Interesting. When was the term shut up invented?
Yoink!	Aw, come on, Mom!
In Gahoole we would break his frickin knees.	No. No valentine for you, Nelson.
No. No valentine for you, Nelson.	Ill give a valentine to a loser. Ill give a valentine to a dork. Ill even give a valentine to a girl. But I wont give a valentine to a bully.
Ill give a valentine to a loser. Ill give a valentine to a dork. Ill even give a valentine to a girl. But I wont give a valentine to a bully.	And what if I dont?
What about a valentine that says Bully, For You?	Hmm, interesting.
Interesting means no.	Interesting means no... Milhouse, youre a genius!
I am? What did I say?	Nothing. On TV, when a guy says something lame, another guy says hes a genius, and then he has an idea. I thought it might work for me.
Well, you called me a genius. That means a lot.	I hate this stupid holiday! The only thing you can do is screw it up. Thats it! Bart, youre a genius!
I fear you? This is what Valentines Day means to you?	This is what it means to everyone. How can you be forced to say I love you? People only give valentines because theyre scared of what would happen if they didnt.
Mm, you can really smell the fear on this.	I rubbed it on Milhouse.
...And its for all these reasons, and more, that the Kingdom of Moab is the least interesting in the Bible. Amen.	Amen! Were done!
Wasnt our sympathetic nodding enough?	Mom, can I have some money?
I hope that wasnt somebodys Aunt Betty or something.	Dad? Please? For Sumadi?
Pipe down, Ned.	Please!
All right, son... but you have to pay me back.	Life is good.
Do you have my money?	What?
Do you have my money?	How could I?
Would you eat anything for money?	I guess. Who are you?
School play. Damn Yankees.	Children of the playground! I will eat anything for money! Except money!
And heres something thatll make you forget about the other stuff.	Ay carumba. So, what else ya got?
Wheres my money! Get my money! Money-money-money-money-money...	Easiest money I ever...
Son, by rights I should be playing banjo at your funeral. That frog was filled to the gills with formaldehyde, a highly toxic poison.	Heres your money, dad.
I named the frog Herb!	Even you wont sit with me?
Whats the matter? Frog in your throat?	Youre the ones that paid me to eat it.
Diggs and Freedom, at your service. Diggs is short for Digby.	Thanks. Im the kid that ate the frog.
Oh, so youre the reason I had to dissect a Muppet in biology today.	Thanks for the help, man.
Oh, youre welcome. At least, from me. Theres no way to say what the bird thinks, or even if he thinks, really.	Wait! Wait! Wait! Who the hell are you?
I transferred here a few months ago.	To this school? On purpose? Even after Springfield Montessori opened across the street?
To this school? On purpose? Even after Springfield Montessori opened across the street?	That place is really in your face.
Im president, secretary-treasurer, and faculty adviser. That took a lot of fancy paperwork but it was worth it to be left alone.	Can I join?
He is just riding that thermal.	You were right about watching him fly.
I thought youd get it. Seat-backs and tray tables, Bart. Were coming in for a landing!	Wow. You dont know how impressive that is to a boy whose dad cant even get the dog to sit.
Oh, I know what that means. There comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. Finally! I was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler.	Bart Simpson, at your service.
More like at your six-pack, am I right? Its okay if you need to take a little nap.	Why would I want a nap?
Because youre so drunk you can barely keep it together!	I wasnt drinking. I was learning that nature isnt a complete waste of space.
But it does sound like the kind of lie youd make up after the first time you got blitzed.	I met this kid. A little older, kind of strange. I dont think other people get him, but I just wanna hang out with him all the time.
If he starts to carry you off, slip out of the glove. Now tell him to fly.	Fly! Fly! Cmon, man! Do the wing thing!
Fly! Fly! Cmon, man! Do the wing thing!	I did it! He did it! We did it!
Whoa! Did you teach him to do that?	I get it. It sucks. Really sucks.
I caught this morning mornings minion, kingdom of daylights dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding / Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding / High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing!	Wow.
Wow.	Ive already eaten.
Hey, you want to see something really cool?	Is a falcons training leash called a creance? Yes!
Is a falcons training leash called a creance? Yes!	Say something so Ill know youre not hurt.
Im really hurt.	Phew!
Bartholomew! Good to see you, old sport. Wheres Freedom?	Well... my Dad said dont bring home anymore dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds.
No, I signed them myself. Theyre people I wouldve liked to come visit.	Listen... what happened in that tree?
I know it sounds a little crazy now, but I suddenly thought maybe we can all fly, but somehow weve forgotten that we can.	You dont still think that, do you?
Bart, heres another doctor that would like a few words with this young man.	This hospital has another doctor?
Well, I hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back. I dont care for how it circles the cat.	Hes just riding the thermals from Dads butt.
At least someone in this family is using them.	I never heard of this new hospital so I looked it up and printed it out.
I dont know Bart. This is one of those... Arkham Asylum-type hospitals.	Diggs isnt cuckoo!
Uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. You know, Dweebler.	Milhouse abandoned me.
Milhouse abandoned me.	So, why cant I go there?
Bart, if this is what I think it is, its not a place we should ever, ever take a little boy.	Then why is Diggs there?
You know, Bart, just because Diggs is a little different doesnt mean hes not a good person.	What would you know about friends like Diggs?
I have about eight of them.	So how do we fix him?
Oh, Bart... Diggs problems dont have easy fixes.	What kind of cheer-up talk is this?
Well... sometimes it helps to know people feel for you. Want a hug?	You hug the bedpost. Then I hug the bedpost. That way we never hug each other.
The rumors of my bonkertude have been greatly exaggerated. D.S.M. Five indicates paranoid schizophrenia. But that work is mired in controversy. Mired.	I knew youd escape! Were you carried out by a flock of falcons?
I got a one-day pass.	Were falcons involved in any way?
I obtained the pass to enter the Springfield Falconry Contest, which is what Freedom and I were training for when we first met you.	Great. Before anything else, let me just get closer to the door and say how crazy are you?
Im fine. My meds wont wear off till tonight. Then Ill have Freedom tear you to shreds.	No offense, but when a crazy guy pretends to be crazy, its not funny.
Fly my pet! Fly! Yes! Yes, now back to papa! Yes.	Why am I not surprised the only sport you do is one where a bird brings you food?
Shut up!	What are you doing?
Were up next. When Freedom hits the air, you and I open all the cages.	Um... with our minds?
Now Bart, Im afraid one-day passes dont last forever. And Im probably not going to get another one for quite a while.	Wait. When will I see you? You cant quit the falconry club!
Its all yours, Mr. President.	Well, I guess some delicate birds are safer in a cage.
Bart, when I pushed you away, I was really pushing away the thought of losing you.	How long did it take you to think that up?
Two hours with the therapist.	Ill take that.
She came in on a Saturday. Missed her kids karate demonstration. He was goin up a belt.	Enough!
Enough!	Mom, you didnt cook the falcon?!
Of course not. Its just duck.	Awww...
Bart, thats your sixth taco. You know, Whitman says, If anything is sacred, the human body is sacred.	Fascinating.
Now, where was I? Right, no need to worry. Im still technically shawshanking it at Springfield Penitentiary.	This is getting boring. Either murder us or tell us how you got here.
I wrote up my results and went from subject to scientist.	Look at me! Im Sideshow Bob!
A mere sip wouldve dissolved a hole in your stomach the size of a silver dollar!	Yakety, yakety, yak.
Yakety, yakety, yak.	The spotted hawk accuses me, he complains of my gab.
The spotted hawk accuses me, he complains of my gab.	I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable... Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass.
I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable... Walt Whitman, Leaves of Grass.	Very good. Lisa, you always were the one rose petal floating atop the cesspool that is the Simpsons.
Very good. Lisa, you always were the one rose petal floating atop the cesspool that is the Simpsons.	/ Thats mean.
Visit me, Lisa. We can discuss poetry, fine art, and if we must, jazz.	Why would you want to do that? Hes tried to kill us.
Dont you think the parts that arent evil are a little pretentious?	Absolutely. Were talking about Lisa, right?
Shut up!	You shut up!
I shall be the wisest and strongest maniac ever to bring the blessings of dictatorship to the world!	Jigs up, Bob!
Jigs up, Bob!	Return the spear to the homo erectus. Homo erectus? Where has that word been all my life?
Now Bart, I promised I wouldnt hurt you.	You did that for me?
But beware, I have DNA in me from Ophiocordyceps Unilateralis, better known as zombie ant fungus!	And were scared of that because...?
Uh... cmon, boy. Your job is to guide me.	Well... I really think you should watch your temper.
I mean down the stairs, you stupid kid!	Stupid kid. Do you really think thats the way we should communicate?
You just wanna see your old man trip and fall! Well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--	Not what I was hoping for, but itll do.
Thats alright, enough about that. Did the clock ever get wound?	My dad buys the underpants gorillas wear during monkey shows. So if youre gonna laugh at Nelson, laugh at me too.
Ooh... they do. My uncle Bill is here right now. Oh, Bill, Bill, Im so sorry I wasnt a very good ladder holder.	This can only be good.
This can only be good.	This family has had a lot of hoods put over their heads.
Lou, youve got a suspicious mind, you know? You remind me of that Elvis song. Uh, Clambake. You know, cause you open your yap when things get hot. Clambake.	Where am I?
Bestow upon him the necklace of unknown retainers.	Um... thanks, but Im not sure I want to be a bully.
Whoa! A tweet from Chester!	Whos Chester?
They say he once wedgied a kid in half.	Whoa...
We dont want any accidents.	Ay carumba.
I cant believe you did that, Bart. I dont even want to sit on the same side of this car with you. Im just doin it for balance.	I didnt shoot him!
Oh yeah? Well, whyd you bring your slingshot?	I dont know. I feel naked without it.
Today we are all Nelson Muntz.	Haw-haw.
Peruvian feather grass, an Incan sleeping mat, and a portrait of Marisol Espinoza, the Vice President of Peru.	Are you sure you didnt create a perfect habitat for you?
I wish I could live in there.	Well theres plenty of room... because Pokeys gone.
Whered he go?	This looks like a job for... fireplace tongs.
I hear chewing!	No, thats a much bigger animal.
Nobody touch it! Bart, stop looking at it!	But I want to see it!
Yes, they sold it to us. So now its our painting. We can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep.	For ourselves?
...so if I keep my mouth shut, you get me new wheelie sneakers, and Bart agrees to promote and encourage use of my new cool nickname, C.J....	You got it, Ceej.
You have no obligation to share the money from that painting. Ooo, a support rock!	This ones against us. This ones for us. For, for, against, for, against...
Oh, Homer Simpson, that painting has torn the town apart, destroyed Kirk and Luanns marriage, and everyones very worried about Milhouse.	Hes been playing Dancing Revolution for hours, but the TV is off.
That picture has brought out the worst in everyone! Please... just let it go!	Youre not gonna let it go, are you?
Boo!	End this madness!
Then you can be a hero like me.	What makes you a hero?
Martin took my topic. What do I do?	Oh, just make a speech about Dad.
Everyone does that.	Everyone does that with good dads. But with our Dad, its like climbing Mount Everest. You either plant your flag at the top of the world or get frozen in agony forever. Either way, Hell of a show.
Congratulations on your purchase of a FootMaster brand soccer ball. Thanks, book!	Look, you got us a free trip. Just slack off and cash your check like you always do.
Man, Krusty should get some of these letters.	While you were out, the gamblers sent up gold-frosted donuts, a chocolate bowling ball, and a fresh pork sandwich.
Wheres your mother?	Went to practice her Portuguese.
Give the donuts to the hotel staff. Release the pig, and the bowling ball, into the wild.	Dad, is it hard for you to turn these bribes down?
Why so quiet?	Im just examining what kind of person I am and whether I should destroy your happiness forever. Eh, why not?
Im listening. And it better be devastating.	You werent Lisas hero. She just swapped you in at the last minute because someone else did her real hero.
Oh my God. Thats, thats shattering. And now, Im a man in pain in the naughtiest city since San Francisco turned all nerdy.	Where are you going?
To drink until theres no pain left in my soul. But first Im gonna eat off someone elses room service tray that was left in the hall!	Now thats a broken man.
Um... Deixar meu marido sozinho!	Hows she doin that?
Oh, are the kids with you?	Hi, Dad! / Homer.
Hey, guys! Why are you ducked down like that?	Dont want to be seen with you when youre hitting bottom.
Oh, not totally...	Wha-- what are you doing in here?
Hiding from the cops.	Well, I cant have cops sniffin around here. Some of them might be girls.
See, thats Jeremy. I need to get him braces. I always thought that if Id had braces Id have smiled more.	Hey, I bet you have a great smile.
Hey, I bet you have a great smile.	Ay carumba!
Bart, Bart! Were in whatchamacallit... a pursuit!	So whyd you come here? I run a respectable treehouse.
Just wondering if youve seen anything. Word is youll, uh, youll snitch for candy.	You cant buy me with a candy bar that has coconut.
Maybe this is more your neighborhood.	Nice real estate. Youve got a deal.
So, what do you know?	I saw a guy with a gun and a snake tattoo say he was gonna hide out on top of Mount Springfield.
Dude, thank you. Why did you save me?	We outlaws have to stick together.
Outlaw? You?	Stolen bowling shoes, 3-D glasses, Krusty standee...and this cage for my pet.
What do you feed him?	My A.D.D. meds.
Listen, would you like two tickets to the school musical. My son plays the butcher... in Fiddler on the Roof.	Im busy that night.
You didnt tell me you had a PlayStadium Four!	Its the first Ive seen it.
Somethings fishy, Bart. Wheres the gift receipt? Wheres the packet of desiccant that says do not eat, and believe me, you shouldnt.	I have a feeling this PlayStadium was liberated from its previous owner and given to me in gratitude.
Liberated? You mean stolen?	You cant spell crime without me.
What the?	Oh, yawn. Another freebie. Better be a sixty-four gig.
Oh, yawn. Another freebie. Better be a sixty-four gig.	Huh? Its full of lame apps Bully Avoider, Nosebook, Insta-Grandma, This was stolen from Milhouse!
From my backpack! Where Puppy Goo-Goo sleeps! Maybe its time to tell me exactly whats going on!	Relax! Listen to the music of this bubble game.
So peaceful... No! I wont let this go! Bart, its time you told me how youve been getting all this stuff.	I helped Snake out of a jam so he paid me back in stolen stuff. It was an honorable arrangement. But I never thought hed steal from you.
You seem stressed.	You wanna suck some Squishee?
Sure.	Careful. Its uncut syrup. They give it to horses before they race.
Bart, Im so sorry. I just wanted to ruin his life, not end it.	You ratted him out? Hes got a kid!
A kid? I was crushed when I lost my Dad and all he did was move to the Holiday Inn. I can still see him smoking on the balcony. He looked like he missed something... maybe me!	So you see, we cant let Jailbird fry.
Time for the Sleepover Detectives!	I didnt say thered be a sleepover.
Thanks for coming down, Bart. You wont need to save me a third time.	Youre going straight?
Yes.	That man sure loved potato salad.
Hey, baby. Hurry boys! Were going camping this weekend!	But our thing was camping.
Wow. Now I see why they call you Miss Hoover.	You mustve been vacuuming for an hour.
Its a whole new day for Nothing Stu!	Wow. Im free! Get ready, world! Ive got a whole new set of mistakes to make!
I said no mayo!	Ay carumba.
Simpson! Smock up!	Every time I do art, some do-gooder teacher sends it straight to a therapist.
Your stuff is pretty disturbing.	Ive never acted on any of it!
Oh Bart, its wonderful!	Really? Wonderful? I just drowned a grasshopper in paint and let him crawl on the paper till he died.
You know what thats called? Mixed-media conceptual art.	No its not, because I hate art.
Oh, then its protest art!	Stop encouraging me!
Training for the Olympics.	I gotta find a way to get rid of my art teacher.
Easy. Voodoo.	Is there a voodoo queen you can direct me to?
Now you have everyting you need for the voodoo. Would you like a bag?	Yes, maam.
Paper or plastic?	Uh, plastic.
Yeah, got it out of her purse.	Howd you do that?
Art teachers dont have a desk. They just throw their purse anywhere.	VOODOO SPELL / VOODOO SPELL / SEAGULL BEAK AND BONE OF MEL
VOODOO SPELL / VOODOO SPELL / SEAGULL BEAK AND BONE OF MEL	PURPLE HEART AND TEAR OF CHUM...
Just had to be tear of chum.	...SEND HER HOME WITH ACHING TUM!
...SEND HER HOME WITH ACHING TUM!	Oh, right, we need one more thing from her purse.
Ive got these.	Hm. Shes got tickets to the play God of Carnage.
Wheres Mrs. Trunch? I need to know the correct density of points in my pointillism.	Sorry, but I dont think well be seeing much of Trunch today.
Sorry, but I dont think well be seeing much of Trunch today.	Yep. I cast a voodoo spell on her. I wont bore you with the dark details, but lets just say shes in no condition for teaching.
Classic wish-makers mistake -- vague language.	So I did make her pregnant?
Of course not. Doesnt work that way.	Just how do women get babies?
Do you know how embarrassed I was to get a call, at my arraignment, for my behavior during the pub crawl, because of a voodoo curse my son placed on his art teacher?	I didnt mean to make her pregnant. I just hate art so much.
Here you go. Put those in the trash, then you can help me unload the dishwasher.	A minute of fun, a lifetime of work. Ive never heard of a pregnancy like this.
Nothings crazy at this point. Are you the boy that makes babies?	I like to think Im the boy that makes families.
Its just... weve been trying so hard to start a family. With all the money weve spent on I.V.F.... you have no idea...	Hm, maybe I can help. But itll cost you.
How much?	Five dollars. Plus one dollar haw-haw insurance.
Look Bart, I really, I cant believe theres a connection here. But, uh, we have some friends who are in the same dark place we were. Can we give them your name?	Only if they have five dollars.
Yes, right. Ill make sure that they have five dollars.	With them.
Look, Im sorry our check bounced, man. I can have the bank teller call you.	Just give me the cash and youll get your drivers license back.
What is your problem, boy?	Maybe when Ive got a Dad who shows up in the morning with no shirt on and rocks on his face, it sets, I dont know, a low bar?
Wow. Ive gotta take that in. While I do, have some bar nuts.	Arent those full of germs?
And this horse, who I have briefly borrowed, is the winner of last years Springfield Stakes -- Rear Admiral. So work your magic and breed me a champion.	Look, Fat Tony. I dont know what you know about voodoo, but it only works on people. Horses? Thats crazy talk!
It would be helpful if he could go undercover with police horses and find out what they know.	Hey, this is all your fault.
LET THEM RUCK THE NIGHT AWAY!	I wouldnt be here if you were more of a role model! Pub crawls, naked Frisbee golf...
I just did that because it was a series of funny words!	Well, its your mediocre fathering that put me on the path to Hell!
Come on, buddy. Just make a champion thoroughbred and were outta here.	Whats his problem?
Hey, you know, I dont think this guy likes girls.	Big deal. I dont like girls either.
Beer transformed that cute little boy into the man you see before you.	Whoa! They like each other!
You know, pregnant is pregnant...	What are you talking about?
LET THEM PLAY! WE WONT LOOK, WELL TURN AWAY / GO MAKE LOVE, THEN EAT SOME HAY...	WELL BE DEAD...SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD
ROLL IN HAY!	OR TOMORROW WE WILL PAY!
I DONT REALLY MIND AT ALL / BUT WHY MUST I GO MOP THE STALL?	ROLL IN HAY!
ROLL IN HAY!	ROLL IN HAY!
ROLL IN HAY!	ROLL IN HAY!
Simpsons! Youre free to go! Louie, drive em home.	Cool, another limo ride!
The limos in the shop. We have a loaner.	Ay carumba
Theres another way you can go.	Dad!
Why cant kids still watch Captain Kangaroo?	Cultures in decline! Deal with it!
Okay with no friends. Thats the saddest thing I can imagine my daughter saying to me.	I can think of worse.
I can think of worse.	The saddest thing would be if you were driving and texting Lisa, and you hit her. And the last thing she texted, before she died, was I got your message. Gnight.
Yes!	Hmm. Nobody likes jazz that much. Even the guy playin it had to take drugs.
As long as you load up on the kale and chia.	No one likes veggie smoothies that much. Or at all. Somethings fishy about that girl, and Im gonna follow her till I find out what.
And Im gonna help you.	I think Ill need you back at headquarters manning the phones.
Great. What do I say?	Just let em ring.
What do you want?	Ive got two things for you this envelope will change your life for the low, low price of five dollars, and Ill throw in a piece of great advice. Tempted?
Whats the advice?	Dont open the envelope.
Mom paid her to be my friend?	Thats mine. Its for my library card.
Happy Mothers Day.	Mothers Day?!
Thats a prison road crew.	I did that last summer. Im not allowed back.
Ive got a secret, Bart.	Thats good.
Wanna know it is?	No.
A chicken feather? Why would you hand this to me? Oh, you mustve figured out I chickened out during the race! Well who are you to judge me?!	I suck?! You suck!
Bart, my truest friend.	I brought you a cake. Read it.
Thats an odd message, but who am I to argue with icing? Will you watch Cassidy the Crocodile with me?	Um... thats kind of a baby show.
Meow, meow, maybe!	Why would a kitten marry a crocodile? Wouldnt it eat her?
Friends help friends in trouble.	No! Turn it off! Its too intense for me!
Weve invited a new athlete to join our do-gooding dream team. Please welcome fleet-footed phenom, Bart Simpson.	Hey everyone. I sure got a lot of attention for winning this years Race Around the School.
Completely deserved!	Yeah, yeah. Thank you, Mel. But I am not here to talk about myself. Milhouse, would you join me at the podium?
Whats going on? Seriously, what, whats transpiring?	Ive gotta set things straight. During that same race, my friend Milhouse was in the lead, when something horrible happened...
Bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie, and thats exactly what he did.	Rather than try to figure out what happened, Milhouse had the courage to move on. To me, thats a hero.
Thats what put me in this dump!	Grampa, everyones callin me a coward.
Well, join the club! Anyone who makes it to old age has got to be part coward.	Come on. You were in World War Two.
After Korea I was drowning in boobies.	Wow, that sounds pretty sweet.
Well, there is a price. You wake up sweating in the middle of the night?	Yes.
So do I. But I get back to sleep by counting the men I let down. Theres Jerry, Izzy, Brooklyn, the ODonnell boys, the lost ship P.T.-108, the Poor Buggers of Meatloaf Ridge, the Andrew sisters...	I understand. You have standards.
Oh dear. The term target audience is taking on a sinister connotation.	Milhouse! This is my chance to make things right!
What are you up to now?	Get on that bus! Ill explain during the explosions!
Look, Maggie. I undid my deed. So Im just gonna take your feather and say goodnight.	Where are these coming from?
Where are these coming from?	Ohhh. I see -- thats all you wanted.
Ohhh. I see -- thats all you wanted.	Hows that, kiddo?
Three feet, nine inches. That should do it.	Dont you know what kind of animal were dealing with?
Okay, enough theory.	Hey, Dad! We made popcorn!
How permissive?	Chief Wiggum shows us crime photos at sleepovers.
Oh, sorry, wrong for this audience. I thought Swapper Jacks was something else.	Krusty, sorry about the roast. They had no right to say those hilarious things.
How can they say Im past my prime? Me! The voice of Ovaltine!	Krusty, why dont you talk to your Dad? Hell cheer you up. Hes a Rabbi. He mustve learned something from that giant star scroll hes always reading.
Kid, does talking to your Dad make you feel better?	Well no... but hes not a rabbi. More of a Flabbi.
Why you little! Ill show you whos a Flabbi!	All right, youre not a Flabbi! Okay! I got it!
No. Somehow a brief act of uncharacteristic generosity solved nothing.	Hey, Krusty.
What? Have you been going to temple?	Yeah. And Ive learned that all religions are equally boring. But theres a reason I went. Come and see.
Kid, theres no way you can cheer me up. Not when whiskey, good deeds and hookers failed.	Whos a hooker?
Dad loved my jokes.	Yeah, I guess he just hated your delivery.
Now to leave a great comment. LOL... thats... got-ta... hurt.	I guess theres nothing left to do but go outside and play. Wait, a sponsored link!
I thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.	I dont know what that stuff blocks.
I told you to clean your room and instead youre watching chest videos! Look at all those bowls of half-eaten cereal!	The cereal on the bottom gets soggy.
I know how cereal works. Now clean your room.	Why should I? Its just gonna get dirty again.
Im in charge. You do what I say.	Ill get to it when I get to it.
Hm, Im not feelin it.	Why do I need to eat broccoli?
Why do I need to eat broccoli?	Look, Ill drink another glass of milk.
You are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. And Im going to sit right here until you do.	Pfft. Youll never out-sit me.
Pfft. Youll never out-sit me.	The sit is on.
Eat your broccoli.	No.
Eat your broccoli.	No.
Jebus loves Tebow.	And so... the fat man caves. If you need me, Ill be up in my room eating cereal. Half a bowl of cereal.
Uh, works for me.	Im in.
Oh, thank God.	Oh no, the broccoli!
I dont know. Eat your broccoli.	No.
Were on an old-time boat!	Weve been kidnapped!
Relation Ship. It works two ways. Pretty good. Pret-ty good.	Hey lame ass. Thanks to you, were stuck on a stupid therapy boat.
Should we do something?	Now can we respect each other?
What about you, Bart... Homer? Homer?	What does that mean?
Sheep shank, bowline, clove hitch...	Dad, look! I did a round turn with two half hitches.
Wait a minute... windswept hair, rugged tan, rough, calloused hands. Youre enjoying this, arent you?	So what if I am?
Youre my son and you will hate what I hate. Angled parking. Lemons. Kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. And this boat!	Im old enough to choose my own things to hate. And the things I like! And I like being a sailor.
Why, Bart! Thats a perfect halyard cleat!	Just like you taught me, Captain. Over, under, over, under, over, under, under, under, over, over, over, over, over, over, over, under, over, half hitch.
Im a-comin bears!	Now Im the ships highest ranking officer. Its up to me to get us to shore.
Are you crazy? Well never make it! Drop the anchor and wait out the storm!	No, we need to sail!
Im dropping the anchor!	Cant you just do what I say?!
Awaiting your orders, Mr. Midshipman!	Put up the storm jib and haul in the main sheet!
Oh Marge, once again youve taken one of my screw-ups and turned it into food. Man, if only you could do that with Bart.	Mo-om! Dads imagining me as food again!
Hey mom, can you pack me a dozen sandwiches in my lunch tomorrow? Meat, no meat, its all good.	Sandwiches, Mom. Fill er up. And the garment bag.
Kids love em. We trade them at school.	They replaced cigarettes as our currency.
Bubble gum cigarettes?	Yeah, sure.
Uh-huh!	Mom, if youre gonna do this, theres one thing I need to know. And be honest. Whats your soda refill policy?
Homie, Im a little worried. Do you know there were no customers between two and four?	Youre supposed to be driving me to a tennis class I said I wanted then I changed my mind and I hate it so much Im faking stomach aches to get out of it.
I said wash! And Bart, go work the deep fryer.	Well, if Ill be doin this when Im forty, might as well start now.
Well, if Ill be doin this when Im forty, might as well start now.	Im home!
Kids, were taking some shredded lettuce, pre-sliced cheese, and cold cuts and turning them into the American dream.	Uh, guys... what the hell is that?
I understand, honey. Did you get someone to cover?	Grampa.
You actually read this thing? It was written by two lawyers who had to keep waking the other one up.	He who reads this rune translation / will be taken to damnation.
Theres no hope for you, Simpson. Youll be locked in detention until you graduate to the penal system.	Penal.
Stop laughing! I said penal not penile.	Penile.
Hm.	Ow! Oh, someone could get really hurt by this.
Hey!	Huh?! Were in Hell?! Cool! Now I can look up all those people who said See you in Hell!
Huh?! Were in Hell?! Cool! Now I can look up all those people who said See you in Hell!	Hey pal, what are you in here for?
Psychological torment. Pain plus fear. Oh, can you all feel how much richer that is? You get a pumpkin sticker.	Ow! This has never happened before! I have a crush on my teacher!
Down here we can make that happen.	Every time the sinner screams in pain, the scream blows this windmill, which pumps even more piranhas into his aquarium underwear... causing more screaming.
Bart! I found a portal back to Earth.	Right here?
No! No! No! No! Thats Super Hell!	Hot Stuff? I didnt realize you were that evil.
Keep your pants on, Marge. Its probably some private school that costs a million dollars a year -- and then they squeeze you for extra money through book fairs and silent auctions. And parents get twenty emails a day from the school, and everyone hits reply all to everything!	Dad, its not a private school. Its free.
Hm. That is the kind of nonsense youre always falling for.	Mom, please tell me I can go to Hell.
Well, I guess we could try it for a semester.	Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Beelzebart, youre first. And youre going to torment a very special sinner weve prepared just for you.	Homer? That-thats my dad. I cant hurt him.
No, boy. I want you to do it.	What? Why?
Well, I guess you and I are in charge now, Bart. But if we split the chores, Im sure we can... what are you doing?!	Sayonara, sucker!
Oh no! Youre not leaving me to clean this up!	Woo hoo! Im the last of the Simpsons!
Its a terrific sport that--	SHHH!
Im not screwing you over. No, uh... Im not screwing you over. Im not screwing you over.	Im so proud of you, poppa.
How about you, Bart? Let me guess, you forgot to bring something.	Im offended you think I forgot. Lets see...
Im offended you think I forgot. Lets see...	Ta-da!
Listen boy, this is the only legacy youll ever leave.	Better make this count.
Probably just another piece of Americas space junk falling out of orbit.	Remember when this country didnt suck? Cause I dont.
The eyes in that picture are following me.	Uh, thats a mirror.
A robot with a catchphrase!	Hey Homer, you gonna kiss him or kill him?
Okay, so what are you?	Must be a secret government project.
You know, they look a little similar.	Yeah, like the guy who designed Bender just took a drawing of Dad and stuck an antenna on it.
What a surprise -- its Bart.	Wow, Im doing the same jokes a thousand years later. Ay carumba!
But how did a mere boy destroy the future?	Well...
Well...	Let this be a lesson never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule.
Why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little...	Dad, it-its me!
Prove it. Whens your birthday?	February twenty-third.
Let me take care of that. If theres one thing I know how to do, its manipulate Barts.	Youre nuts. Ive got a will of iron.
Theyre evolving! Wow. Thats a first for you, Bart.	Will you shut up?
Does he have O.C.D.? O.C.D.? O.C.D.?	I dunno. But in ten minutes Im gonna have him kneeling before Zod. In this example, Im Zod.
I dunno. But in ten minutes Im gonna have him kneeling before Zod. In this example, Im Zod.	When he opens the door...
Bart, this guy served two tours in middle school! Abort prank!	I will not. Anything to delay a spelling test!
Smellson? I prayed no one would ever think of that.	Ay carumba!
How was your first day at school, Bart?	Terrible.
You wanna talk about it?	No.
Why are you wearing your hat at dinner?	This new teacher I got gave me a haircut.
A haircut? Let me see!	No.
No.	No, youll laugh at me.
I didnt know that a teacher could cut kids hair.	Teachers union won the right in their last strike.
Lets continue this online.	Ive created a fake Miss Hoover profile. When Lassen friends her, well know everything about him.
I dont know, Bart. Youre lying about your identity? Thats against the terms and conditions.	Weve all read the terms and conditions, Milhouse.
So I hear youre getting back at Lassen.	Maybe I am. So?
Ill take that.	Heres Lassens profile
Heres Lassens profile	What the?
What the?	Tagged as Lassen!
Youre starting to look like your Dad.	Nooo!
Marge, I have a confession to make about this trip.	Dad, dont worry, I got you a place.
No.	There he is.
His nipples are asymmetrical. This could ruin him!	Milhouse, everyone here is a total freak. We have to find a way to completely humiliate Lassen.
Maybe we should just give up on Lassen.	No. This Ignis thing is the biggest deal of his life. And Im gonna wreck it. Because he scarred me forever!
Hey, it grew back. A little better even. So full and lush...	Enough!
Fire retardant?!	If Lassen cant light that thing, hell be humiliated. What good is an Ignis who cant blaze the guy?
You! Maybe we wont have Blazing Guy, but we can still have... blazing boy.	Help me, desert weirdoes!
Apu and the band appeared on Saturday Night Live as the punchline in a game show sketch.	Whats a game show?
You know what? Apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. Were gonna be like Genesis after Peter Gabriel left.	You mean more popular but not as good?
I dont know.	Its Christmas Eve, man! We do not want to set a precedent for fat guys being late tonight.
Christmas Eve. The one night a kid wants to go to sleep is the one night he cant. I cant have another cocoa.	My pee is starting to smell like a ski chalet.
My pee is starting to smell like a ski chalet.	Oh, thank God you are here. I need to get to sleep. Tell me the story of jazz again.
Well, the story of jazz starts with the tresillo, the most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-Saharan African music, but the rest will have to wait. Bart, Bart, I hear Mom sobbing and I dont know where Dad is!	If it helps, I made you a card.
Bart! This is the year Ive got to nail Christmas. I dont want to be a jaded ten-year-old like you!	Ah, yes... I remember Christmas Eve when I was eight.
... Ooh!... ...	They say a boy never gets over seeing his Dad in a Santa suit getting hanged and electrocuted on Christmas Eve. Ill help you, kid.
Lisa, sweetie, Im tired of being a pushover.	Youre not a pushover.
You cant smoke!	Just chewing on the wood.
Im sorry, Marge, Im sorry, but it was Christmas and we were under the mistletoe...	Thats lettuce caught in a spiders web.
You came to see me! Aww! Easter came early this year!	I thought we were just going to ask if he had seen Homer.
Bart! You know you cant open a present till Mom and Dad wake up!	Its nine-ten a.m.! I know what theyre doing. Theyre up in bed watching the rebroadcast of the Hollywood Christmas Parade.
Its nine-ten a.m.! I know what theyre doing. Theyre up in bed watching the rebroadcast of the Hollywood Christmas Parade.	Oops. My finger slipped.
I got a chemistry set!	I want yours!
Turn it off!	We did.
RIDING ON A BUG / RIDING ON A BUG / YOUD RATHER BE IN SCHOOL / THAN RIDING ON A BUG / RIDING ON A BUG / RIDING ON A BUG...	Bug be damned!
Bug be damned!	Ay carumba!
Purchased for four billion, I was. Yet still hoodie ragged, wear I do, this.	Pirates of the Caribbean!
Ha-ha! My cartoons werent good, they were just first!	Not enough ketchup!
well, thats it. Weve visited every section including Churro County, Toonton Abbey...but you know what we havent had here? Ill tell you fun. The kind of fun attractive families have in commercials.	Hey, Dad, I see a ride that actually looks decent!
I just wanna sit down, but the line for the bench is too long.	No, look! Its a ride that just opened and no ones there!
We have begun our descent to our home planet. Please turn off all portable electronic devices.	Whos gonna stop me?
Now I am here to complete your knowledge of our great and generous species.	Are you the guy that talks nice before they kill us?
Theres only one fair solution we have to put it to a vote.	Before we vote, Id just like to point out in Sophies Choice she saved the boy.
Tis a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before.	Hey look, Maggie made you a farewell card.
And away we go!	Way to go, George Mucus. The fattest, stupidest man on Earth slipped right through your sticky tentacles.
What?!	Dad said I could try it.
Its all right. I have seen many glories and have only one regret that my breasts arent bigger.	I dont see any breasts.
Right. Conquering.	At least Maggie can fly us home.
The circus? Hmmm, I havent been to the circus since I was a kid.	Is that true?
No woman uses one of these by choice.	Hey Dad, since weve gotta wait, cant we please see an act?
I know you are but what am I, infinity plus one! Jinx!	Only the coolest kid ever could think of that! Good golly, Sven-Golly! You did it!
Do not force the truth. For now, treat Homer just as you would a regular ten-year-old boy.	Can he be nine so I can beat him up?
Oh, Im afraid not. The rules of hypnotism are inflexible.	Then can we get pizza on the way home?
Ask for boogers on Barts half!	Good one.
Id be too nervous. Have you noticed that shes kinda hot?	Gross! Weird! Complicated! Go to sleep!
...did I say graham crackers?... chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire...	Oops, my homework!
Guess I chose the wrong day to wear culottes.	Every days the wrong day to wear culottes. Youre it!
Can I play?	Oh, God, no.
Today was fun.	Yeah! Listen, Homer...do you ever think about what you want to do when youre grown up?
Ill eat in bed. Not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna... Oh, and TV would be on. Loud.	Hey, would you ever wanna have a real job and a family?
Yeah. Thank God that never happened.	Wow. He doesnt want to be my Dad. He just wants to be a kid like me. Almost makes me not wanna prank him. Almost.
Well leave you alone.	You did it, Homer! You saved me from the bullies! Youre the coolest kid I ever met.
What about me?	Youre in the top hundred.
Boo-yeah!	Now youre not.
D-DOO DOO DOO DOO DOO! Yknow, youre the closest thing Ive ever had to a brother.	Me too. And you know what? Im afraid you might... change back.
Change back to what?	Look in the lake. Tell me what you see.
Bloated corpse under the water. Id say hes been there a few months at least. Interesting the way his lips move just like mine. Why do you ask?	No reason. Brother.
Ive been emotionally dealing with that all week. So, yes.	Well, now that hypnotist is gonna come back and snap him out of it!
Look, Dad had to get cured some time. Theres nothing we can do about it.	Or isnt there not?
Your second childhood is over! Youre going back to taking statins and paying FICA!	No! You cant take him now! Weve only been on two rides!
Hey, you shouldve used Fast Pass!	Fast Pass cant solve everything!
Bye, Bart. Stay ten forever.	Goodbye, friend.
What the? Lasagna in bed?!	Recommended by a kid I used to know.
Yknow, I used to have this friend... I told him all my dreams. Really, really great kid.	You think so?
The best. Wonder what ever happened to him.	Well... maybe you sat on him and he was never seen again.
What do you say, boy? Wanna split the lasagna?	Get lost.
Its working! Its definitely working!	For once were finally gonna catch that mouse!
For once were finally gonna catch that mouse!	Gotcha!
Okay. Bart, think of a name. Make it great. Insanely, unbelievably great!	Squawky?
Bart, what are you doing?	Disable auto-drive.
Foolish boy. Youll never guess Elon Musks master password.	Musk rulez. With a z.
Goodbye, Elon. Our town will never forgive you!	Thanks for the real working light saber!
Thanks for the real working light saber!	Ay carumba!
Lets see... What rhymes with Jebediah?	Tire fire.
How about Patty and Selma?	Fatty and Smell-ya.
Mr. Teeny?	Sister weenie.
Sister weenie.	Lisa is blown away.
Youve got a gift!	Well, dont be so surprised, I did write that Lisa, Its Your Birthday song.
Yeah, with that mental patient who thought he was Michael Jackson.	Whoa. Thinking back, Im kinda surprised Mom and Dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom.
Bart, I need your help to write a new anthem for Springfield. Will you team up with me?	Hmmm, whats in it for me?
Oh Lord.	Whoa, that is the best deal any songwriter ever got. And thats true even if I dont get the brownies. Im in.
What are you doing?	Whats it look like? Writing a song.
We did it! We wrote an awesome song!	We make a great brother and sister team. Like Andy and Lana Wachowski.
Should we hug?	Hm, how about a fist bump through a towel.
Gonna be a tight fit.	SPRINGFIELDS THE ONLY HOME WEVE GOT...
WEVE GOT A BIG SINKHOLE...	AND THEY SHUT DOWN THE THINKHOLE...
BUT WHEN YOU THINK OF THE THINGS WE LACK...	STEAD OF THE STUFF WEVE GOT...
WHY SPRINGFIELD? WHY NOT!	WEVE ONLY HAD A HURRICANE ONCE!
Whos he giving a piggyback ride to?	We dont know.
Mom, whats wrong?	How come Dads not with you?
He chose to spend the night in a jail with strangers instead of with me.	Mom, Lisa and I learned we could solve any problem through song. Lisa, lets go write something thatll change Dads mind.
Do you really think that we can write a song that does that?	I just wanted to get out of the room. She was really bumming me out.
I just wanted to get out of the room. She was really bumming me out.	Aw, geez, I thought writing another hit song would be easier.
Take it, Bart!	You take it!
I gave it to you!	I refuse to accept it!
Youve got me there.	Its her fault! She was suckin all the gangsta out of everything!
Well youre the only gangsta I know with a nine oclock bedtime!	Nine-thirty, starting in summer! Mom said!
Well, not all of them. Like, um, ninety percent?	God doesnt hear my prayers. If he did, Id be at home on the couch playing video games in a diaper.
Dont worry, Reverend, according to your policy, your church is covered for everything but acts of God.	Mom, the freezer broke and--!
Go Southern Illinois!	Saluki Strut!
And its not even against the rules.	Dad, mom trusted us with a secret--
Im telling mom about how the school freezer broke and they had to cook all the tater tots and the teachers took the extra tots home in manila envelopes!	Im telling her!
Ok, Mel. Ill be at the casino by ten. Meet me at the lounge by the J. Geils cover band.	Are you... a hostess?
Its not gambling! Its math.	Is Dad in on this takedown?
But its okay for you guys to know, because youre finally grown-up enough to be trusted with adult information.	Yeah, we are grown up.
I know how much to tip a waiter.	I go on hikes with my friends where we talk about our problems.
Isnt Bart sweet, Homer? He sings like a little angel.	JINGLE BELLS, BATMAN SMELLS, ROBIN LAID AN EGG / THE BATMOBILE BROKE ITS WHEEL, THE JOKER GOT AWAY.
All right, children. Let me have those letters. Ill send them to Santas workshop at the North Pole.	Oh, please. Theres only one fat guy that brings us presents and his name aint Santa.
A what!	Yeah, theyre cool and they last the rest of the your life.
Yeah. If you want one, youll have to pay for it out of your own allowance.	All right!
Ooh.	Oh. Neat-o.
I do!	All right, the mall!
Wait a minute. How old are you?	Twenty-one, sir.
Yes, Mrs. Simpson, we can remove your sons tattoo. Its a simple routine involving lasers.	Cool!
Ow! Quit it.	Ow! Quit it!
Ow! Quit it!	Ow! Quit it!
Ow! Quit it!	Ow! Quit it!
Hey! Whats with this?	Ow! Quit it. It used to be a real boss tattoo.
Can we go too, Dad?	Can we?
So, what do you think kids? Beauty, isnt it?	Yeah, Homer.
I cant believe those kids are fallin for it.	Hey, Milhouse. I dare you to sit on his lap.
Oh, yeah? Well, I dare you to yank his beard off.	Ah, touchÃ©!
I will when Mrs. Clauss sisters get out of town. Thanks for listening, kid.	Hey Santa, whats shaking?
Whats your name, Bart... ner? -- Er -- Little partner?	Im Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Im Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?	Here?
Im Jolly Old Saint Nick.	Oh, yeah? Well just see about that.
Oh, yeah? Well just see about that.	Homer!
Nobody knows. Its a secret. I didnt get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas, Id do anything.	Ill say, Dad. You must really love us to sink so low.
See you next year.	Come on, Dad. Lets go home.
Uh-uh.	Ah, come on Dad, this can be the miracle that saves the Simpsons Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, its that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and its gonna happen to us.
What! That scrawny little bag of bones?	Come on, Dad. Theyre all scrawny little bags of bones.
Whoa! Ninety-nine times thirteen equals MER-RY CHRISTMAS!	I got a bad feeling about this.
Dont you believe in me, son?	Uh...
Come on, boy. Sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going.	Oh, go for it, Dad.
Around the first turn.	Come on, Santas Little Helper!
Come on, Santas Little Helper!	Come on, dog! Go, man! Go! Come on Santas Little Helper! Run baby run!
Go! Go!	Go Santas Little Helper!
Come on, boy.	Come on, get that rabbit.
Find any winners, son?	Sorry, Dad.
Beat it! Scram! Get lost! You came in last for the last time.	Look, Dad. Its Santas Little Helper.
Oh, no you dont. No. No. Get away from me. Uh-uh.	Oh, can we keep him Dad, please?
Homer!	Ill pay! How much?
I didnt get my Christmas bonus. I tried not to let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did, I just couldnt --	Hey, everybody. Look what we got!
So love at first sight is possible.	And if he runs away, hell be easy to catch.
RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER / HAD A VERY SHINY NOSE / AND IF YOU EVER SAW IT / YOU WOULD EVEN SAY IT GLOWED	Like a light bulb!
THEY NEVER LET POOR RUDOLPH / JOIN IN ANY REINDEER GAMES...	Like strip poker!
THEN ALL THE REINDEER LOVED HIM / AS THEY SHOUTED OUT WITH GLEE / RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER / YOULL GO DOWN IN HISTORY...	Like Attila the Hun!
Not I.D., Dad. Id. Its a word.	As in, this game is stup-id.
Get outta here.	My turn. Kwyjibo. K-W-Y-J-I-B-O.
My turn. Kwyjibo. K-W-Y-J-I-B-O.	Twenty-two points. Plus triple word score. Plus fifty points for using all my letters. Games over. Im outta here.
Wait a minute, you little cheater. Youre not going anywhere until you tell me what a kwyjibo is.	Kwyjibo Uh, a big, dumb, balding...
Kwyjibo Uh, a big, dumb, balding...	North American ape... with no chin...
Ill show you a big dumb balding ape!	Uh-oh, Kwyjibo on the loose!
Look out Bart, here comes Skinner!	Yikes.
Simpson, you and I are going to have a little talk.	Same time, same place?
Bart, I hope you wont bear some sort of simple-minded grudge against me. I was merely trying to fend off the desecration of the school building.	Eat my shorts.
Remember to visualize the complex problems. And relax. The test will start... NOW!	At seven-thirty a.m. an express train traveling sixty miles an hour leaves Santa Fe bound for Phoenix, five hundred and twenty miles away.
Shhhhh! Visualize it, Bart!	At the same time a local train traveling thirty miles an hour and carrying forty passengers leaves Phoenix bound for Santa Fe.
At the same time a local train traveling thirty miles an hour and carrying forty passengers leaves Phoenix bound for Santa Fe.	Its eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car.
Its eight cars long and always carries the same number of passengers in each car.	An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off, but three times as many plus six get on.
An hour later, a number of passengers equal to half the number of minutes past the hour get off, but three times as many plus six get on.	Oof!
Oof!	At the second stop, half the passengers plus two get off, but twice as many get on as got on at the first stop.
Ticket, please.	I dont have a ticket.
Twice the fare from Tucson to Flagstaff minus two thirds of the fare from Albuquerque to El Paso.	Yaaaaahhh!
Tell me, Bart, are you ever bored in school?	Oh, you bet.
Um-hmmm... Ever feel a little frustrated?	All the time, sir.
Uh-huh. Do you ever dream of leaving your class to pursue your own intellectual development on an independent basis?	Wow, its like youre readin my mind, man.
Bart, wed like you to try a kind of school that doesnt rely on grades and rules and bells and buzzers. A school without walls. Where you do as much or as little of the assignments as you feel you need to. Does that sound good, Bart?	Sign me up, Doc.
You look very intelligent, dear.	No way.
How bout a tie, son? Everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties.	Youre stifling my creativity, Dad.
I dont care what that stupid test says, Bart. Youre a dimwit.	Maybe so, but from now on, this dimwit is on Easy Street.
The hook goes over the top and these things go in there.	Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.	You kissed me.
Let me say right at the start that we have one rule here Make your own rules. If you feel sleepy, take a nap. If you get bored, feel free to take out a book and start reading.	What should I read, maam?
Why, anything you want, Bart.	Ohhh!
O Memsahib Bart, Rabbi has memo.	What?
Trab, ing norm doog.	Whats your problem?
Hi, Bart.	Cool. Hamsters! What are their names?
Hamster number one has been infected with a staphylococci virus. Hamster number two is the control hamster.	Hi, lil control hamster.
And now we can continue our debate from yesterday. When we left off, Calvin and Tanya were arguing that free will is an illusion.	Oh, Mom! Not tonight.
Um-hmm, um-hmm... Well, it seems the smartest child in the class is also the quietest. Bart, what other paradoxes affect our lives?	Well... youre damned if you do, and youre damned if you dont.
Well, I guess that would be a paradox, too. Thank you, Bart.	Whew!
Tell you what, Bart! Ill trade you the weight of a bowling ball on the eighth moon of Jupiter from my lunch for the weight of a feather on the second moon of Neptune from your lunch.	Well, okay.
I will trade you one thousand picoliters of my milk for four gills of yours.	Well, all right.
Uh, Bart, would you wager your cupcake against my...	Save your breath.
So, how was it?	Os-os.
What?	Thats backwards for so-so.
Tell you what To celebrate your first day of genius school, whaddaya say we go out for a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?	All righty!
Shhh!	Toreador, oh, dont spit on the floor / Please use the cuspidor, thats what its for.
Hes the bullfighter.	No way a bull is gonna miss a target that big, man.
P.U. When is this over?	It aint over till the fat lady sings.
Well, dont you get it, Bart? Derivative D-Y equals three R squared D R over three, or R squared D R, or R D R R. Hardy-har-har! Get it?	Oh, yeah.
Well, come on, you two. Dont forget about the film festival.	The what?
Sorry, Bart. Your mother bought us tickets to a snooty movie directed by some Swedish meatball.	Oh, no.
Well, I guess we dont have to do that.	Um, look Dad, I got something to tell you.
Can it wait, son? Its getting kinda dark.	All right, Homer, come on, baby. Right across the plate -- lemme feel the wind.
Can you still see the ball, Bart?	Dont worry, homeboy, youre not that fast.
Oh, you dont think so, eh? Well, here comes some real heat.	Whoa! Yeah, strike three! Youre outta there.
So what was it you wanted to tell me, son?	Uh, nothin, Pop.
Im still trying to get you a lab partner, Bart. If we dont get any volunteers soon, Ill assign somebody. Say, whats that? It looks dangerous.	Well, its really pretty top secret, maam.
All right, keep going. But you do know what happens when you mix acids and bases, right?	Course I do!
Now, Bart, we want to emphasize that nobodys angry about this. Were... were just concerned. When a young man with a two hundred sixteen I.Q. cant make a simple experiment work, well, it doesnt take a Bart Simpson to figure out that somethings wrong. Tell me, is the class moving too slowly for you?	Lord, no.
Well then what can we do to make you happy?	I want to go back to my old class.
Oh, but, Bart, dont you remember the boredom... the ennui... the intellectual malaise?	Yeah, well, you know... kinda... but I was thinking I could go undercover.
Undercover? Bart, Im intrigued. Go on.	Well, I could pretend Im a regular dumb kid. You know... to study them, and all the stuff they do with each other. You know, see what makes them tick.
I see... like Jane Goodall and the chimps.	Yeah.
Uh-huh, this is most impressive, Bart. You write up your proposal while I talk to Principal Skinner.	Proposal?
You know, outline your project, what you hope to achieve, what youll require to do it.	Gotcha, man.
Bart, what happened?	I had a little accident in chemistry today.
Dont be discouraged, son. I bet Einstein turned himself all sorts of colors before he invented the light bulb.	Dad... I gotta tell you something... Hope you wont be too mad...
What is it, son?	Im not a genius, Dad.
What?	I cheated on the intelligence test. Im sorry. But I just want to say that the past few weeks have been great. Me and you have done stuff together, youve helped me out with things, and were closer than weve ever been. I love you, Dad, and I think if something can bring us that close, it cant possibly be bad.
Why, you little -- !	Wuh-oh!
You cant stay in there forever!	I can try.
March your butt right out here. Now!	No way, man!
But -- son, if you dont come out I cant hug you... and kiss you... and make you feel all better.	Do you think Im dumb enough to fall for that. Im insulted.
Now, class, I dont want this field trip to be a repeat of our infamous visit to the Springfield State Prison. So I want you all to be on your best behavior. Especially you, Bart Simpson.	Mrs. Krabappel, I didnt unlock that door.
All right children, count off.	Hey, Otto. Hey, Ottoman.
Hey, Bartdude.	Any new tattoos, Otto?
Oh, funny you should ask, man. This morning I woke up with this one.	Cool! I want one.
Take your seat, Bart.	Oh, please, Mrs. Krabappel, not next to Wendell. He pukes on every bus ride.
Oh, please, Mrs. Krabappel, not next to Wendell. He pukes on every bus ride.	No offense, Wendell.
Now, class, remember do not stick any part of your body out the window. We all know the tragic story of the young man who stuck his arm out the window and had it ripped off by a big truck coming in the other direction.	And I was that boy!
Bart, not another word out of you, or Ill subject you to the humiliation of making you sing in front of the class.	Can I pick the song?
No. The song will be, John Henry Was A Steel Drivin Man.	Oh, no.
Hey, Bart. Our dad says your dad is incompetent.	What does incompetent mean?
It means he spends more time yakking and scarfing down donuts than doing his job.	Oh, okay. I thought you were puttin him down.
Hey, theres my dad. Hey, Dad! Yo, Homer!	Woo! Woo! Im up here!
Yeah, Dad. You can do it!	Yeah, go for it, Dad.
Youre right! Im young, Im able-bodied, and Ill take anything. Watch out, Springfield, here I come.	Dont give up, Dad.
Moes Tavern.	Is Mr. Freely there?
Who?	Freely. First initials, I.P.
Dad, eat something. Its got mustard on it.	All he does is lie there like an unemployed whale.
I dont know what else to do.	Theres only one thing we can do. Take advantage of the old guy. You gotta sign my report card, Dad.
What?	Someone swiped my piggy bank.
There he is!	Dont do it, Dad!
Oh, Homer, how could you think of killing yourself? We love you.	Yeah, Dad. / Yeah. / We love you.
Well its no secret our citys under siege by a graffiti vandal known as El Barto. Police artists have a composite sketch of the culprit. If anyone has any information, please contact us immediately.	Cool, man!
Dont be nervous. We believe in you, Homer.	Oh, yeah?
Yeah!	Oh, yeah?
All right, Dad!	Way to go, Homer!
Wow!	Gee, Dads a hero.
What did you say, son?	Nothin.
Our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or I. Many of them, incompetent boobs. I know this because I have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. And I say, this stinks!	Right on, Dad!
The generous offer Im making is good for exactly thirty seconds, Simpson.	Oh, yeah?
But, dont worry. Ive just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!	Hey, thats my pop up there! Dad watch out!
You were? Aw, well go ahead.	You love him more!
No, you do!	No, I dont!
Yes, you do!	No I dont!
Tough choice.	Im picking respect.
Oh yes. And this must be your lovely wife... ... Marge. And look at little... ... Lisa. Why, shes growing like a weed. And this must be... ... Brat.	Bart.
And make yourselves at home.	Hear that, Dad? You can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself.
Where are you, kids?	Ooops!
Gotcha!	Whoa careful, Dad. Blow a gasket and you lose your job.
You remember the rules from last year?	Yeah. Shut my mouth and let your boss win.
Yeah. Shut my mouth and let your boss win.	Hey!
Go, Mr. Burns.	Man, this is pathetic. Im goin for it.
Quick, Bart, give me a kiss.	Kiss you? But, Dad, Im your kid!
Me first!	No, me!
No, me!	No, Me!
Me!	Me.
This is where you belong.	Yeah, Homer. Room for one more.
Yeah, Homer. Room for one more.	One of us! One of us! One of us! One of us!
No. Were going to say grace first.	Okay. Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub.
Maybe we should move to a larger community.	Dont have a cow, Dad.
Look at that, kids! No fighting, no yelling...	No belching.
Now, look, you know and I know this family needs help. Professional help. So I made us an appointment with Dr. Marvin Monroe.	The fat guy on TV?
No, Dad! Please dont pawn the TV!	Oh, cmon Dad! Anything but that!
Ogre is such a strong word.	Right on, Doc. Another successful diagnosis.
Good idea.	All right!
Wait a minute. These mallet things are padded with foam rubber. Whats the point?	Theyd work much better without the padding, Doc.
No, no. Thats not true.	See.
Arrrgh!	Just testing.
Oh, yes, doctor.	Arrrgh!
Bart, how could you shock your little sister?	My finger slipped.
My finger slipped.	Arrrgh!
Arrrgh!	Arrrgh!
No, no!	Arrrgh!
Stop! Stop! Youre damaging the equipment.	Hey, nice hair, Mom.
Its not the money as much as the feeling that we earned it.	You did it, Dad.
That piece of junk? Forget it! Were going to get a new TV! Twenty-one-inch screen... realistic flesh tones... and a little cart so we can wheel it into the dining room on holidays!	Yay!
Ah. Say no more.	Yum. Dont mind if I do!
Bart!	Oh, man.
Its Mrs. Hoovers birthday!	You know, there are names for people like you.
No there arent.	Teachers pet, apple polisher, butt kisser...
Bart, youre saying butt kisser like its a bad thing.	Huh?
Oh, brother.	Uh oh, school bus! Gotta go.
Yo, Bart-dude.	Hey, can you believe it, man? My sister here made a whole pile of cupcakes to butter up her teacher, and she wont give anybody else even one measly little crumb!
Youre welcome.	Better let me hold these, Lis.
Forget it.	You sniveling toad! You little egg sucker!
Tell me more.	Backscratcher! Foot licker! Honor student!
Youll never get one now, Mr. Name-caller.	All right, all right. Look. Im sorry. I-I got upset. In the heat of the moment, I said some things I didnt mean.
You werent thinking, were you?	No.
Im not a sniveling toad, am I?	Not really.
Not really.	Does not.
Im not a little egg sucker, am I?	Of course not.
Then what am I?	A beautiful human being.
What do you like best about me?	Well, Id have to say... your generous nature, your spirit of giving.
Open your mouth, and close your eyes, and you will get a big surprise.	Thanks, Lis. Youre the best.
Hey! Give those back!	Hey, whats the big idea? Thats my sister, man!
So what?	So give her back those cupcakes before I knock your block off.
Hey, wait a minute. Youre right. You made me bleed my own blood.	Uh, it was an ACCIDENT, man. A terrible ghastly mistake! Ask anybody!
Uh, it was an ACCIDENT, man. A terrible ghastly mistake! Ask anybody!	Uh, oh. A cold wind!
Ill get you after school, man.	But...
Oh, no no no. Hell get you after school, son. Now hurry up. Its time for class.	But...
Bart. Its lunchtime.	I aint gonna get outta the fourth grade alive.
Youve gotta tell Principal Skinner, Bart.	But I cant squeal. It would violate the code of the school yard.
Yay!!!	Look, everybody. I would just as soon not make a big deal out of this. Im not saying Im not a hero. Im just saying that I fear for my safety.
Look out!	Nelson, it was all a mistake. This is how it happened, man -- Listen up, you may get a kick out of it. -- My sister was baking cupcakes this morning and...
Put em up!	Boy, you sure taught me a lesson. Whew! Thanks guys. I guess now all thats left is a hearty handshake. Right guys?
Is three fifteen good for ya?	Uh, not really.
Too bad.	Oh no.
Oh no.	Oh man, that guys tough to love.
Bart, what happened to you?	Lets just say I paid the inevitable price for helping out my sister.
Bart, your mother has the fool idea that youre upset about something.	Dad... I need help... Please...
So, whats the problem, son?	I had a run-in with a bully.
Well, Bart, I hope youre going straight to the principal about this.	I guess I could do that.
The code of the School yard, Marge! The rules that teach a boy to be a man. Lets see... Dont tattle... Always make fun of those different from you... Never say anything unless youre sure everyone feels exactly the same way you do... Hmmm, what else... ?	I know.
Oh Homer, thats ridiculous. Bart, instead of fighting, why dont you try a little understanding?	What do you mean, Mom?
Shh! This bully friend of yours... Is he a little on the chunky side?	Yeah, - hes pretty chunkified, all right.
Huh huh. And Ill bet he doesnt do well in his studies either.	No. Hes pretty dumb. Hes in all the same special classes I am.
See, that boy? You didnt expect that, did you? And neither will he.	You mean I should fight dirty, Dad?
Unfortunately, son, we Simpsons sometimes have to bend the rules a little in order to hold our own.	Amen.
So the next time this bully thinks youre gonna throw a punch, you throw a glob of mud in his eyes, and then you sock him when hes staggering around, blinded...	Yeah!
And theres nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.	Gotcha.
And if you get the chance, get em right in the family jewels. That little doozys been a Simpson trademark for generations.	Thanks, Pop.
Remember the family jewels, son.	Whoa! Ouch! Ow! Ooh! Oh no, boys, not the can, please.
Why dont you go see Grampa?	What can he do?
Hell give you good advice. Hes the toughest Simpson alive.	He is?
Half the people here are named Grampa.	Well, Grampa Simpson then.
Second floor, third dank room on the left.	Thanks lady.
Dear Advertisers I am disgusted with the way old people are depicted on television. We are not all vibrant, fun-loving sex maniacs. Many of us are bitter, resentful individuals who remember the good old days when entertainment was bland and inoffensive. The following is a list of words I never want to hear on television again. Number one Bra. Number two Horny. Number three Family jewels.	Hi, Grampa!
Bart! What brings you here?	I need some advice, Grampa. See, theres this bully at school who keeps beating me up.
Hello, young American.	Hello, sir. Uh... Mr. Herman, did you lose your arm in the war?
My arm? Well, let me put it this way. Next time your teacher tells you to keep your arm inside the bus window, you do it.	Yes, sir. I will.
Strategy? Hmmm. How many men do you have?	None.
That way everything you do will be nice and legal. Okay, I can use this one from the FrancoÂ­ Prusssian War. Ill just change Otto von Bismark to read Bart Simpson and...	Psst! Grampa! I think this guys a little nuts.
Yeah, its way past fifteen hundred hours.	Okay. We all know why were here, right?
No, why?	To fight Nelson, the bully.
To fight Nelson, the bully.	That guys been tormenting all of us for years. And I for one am sick of it.
That guys been tormenting all of us for years. And I for one am sick of it.	I cant promise you victory. I cant promise you good times, but the one thing I do know...
I cant promise you victory. I cant promise you good times, but the one thing I do know...	Whoa! Whoa! All right, okay. I promise you victory. I promise you good times.
I got a B in arithmetic.	Woulda got an A but I was sick!
We are rubber, you are glue.	It bounces off us and sticks to you.
It bounces off us and sticks to you.	Sound off!
One, two.	Sound off!
Its my nerves, sir. I just cant stand the barking anymore.	Your nerves!
Your nerves!	I wont have cowards in my army.
I wont have cowards in my army.	Ow!
Sorry, Bart. You can push them out of a plane, you can march them off a cliff, you can send them off to die on some God-forsaken rock. But, for some reason, you cant slap em. Now, apologize to that boy right now.	Sorry, man.
Its cool.	In English class I did the best.
In English class I did the best.	Because I cheated on the test.
Because I cheated on the test.	Sound off!
One, two.	I cant hear you.
Three four.	All right, theres your enemy! Now hit him! Hit him! Lets go, next group! Martinez! Steinberg! OHara! Chang! Olajuwon! Herman!
All right, theres your enemy! Now hit him! Hit him! Lets go, next group! Martinez! Steinberg! OHara! Chang! Olajuwon! Herman!	We are happy. We are merry.
We are happy. We are merry.	We got a rhyming dictionary.
We got a rhyming dictionary.	Sound off!
One two.	One more time.
Three four.	Bring it on home now.
Nelsons at the Elm Street Video Arcade.	Intelligence indicates he shakes down kids for quarters at the Arcade, then heads to the Kwik-E-Mart for a cherry Squishee.
And thats where well hit him. When he leaves the Kwik-E-Mart, well start the saturation-bombing. We got the water balloons?	Two hundred rounds, sir. Is it okay if they say Happy Birthday on the side?
Nelsons at the arcade, General.	Battle stations!
Well, looky here. Little Bart Simpson.	Nelson, Im afraid Im going to have to teach you a lesson.
Ha! Oh yeah? You and what army?	This one. Artillery...commence saturation bombing.
The second you untie me, Im going to beat you to death, man.	Well... if thats going to be your attitude, Im not going to untie you.
Hah! Youre gonna have to sometime.	Uh oh, hes right!
Dont you worry. I was ready for this eventuality. Armistice Treaty. Article Four. Nelson is never again to raise his fists in anger... Article Five... Nelson recognizes Barts right to exist. Article Six... although Nelson shall have no official power, he shall remain a figurehead of menace in the neighborhood.	Wow, sounds good to me. Okay. Ill sign.
Are you boys through playing war?	Yeah.
Good. Then here are some cupcakes.	Oh, boy!
Not now, Marge.	Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Contrary to what youve just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun. There are no winners, only losers. There are no good wars, with the following exceptions the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars Trilogy. If youd like to learn more about war, theres lots of books in your local library -- many of them with cool, gory pictures. Well, good night, everybody. Peace, man.
Oh, Homer, youd lose your head if it werent securely fastened to your neck.	Did you check the den?
Do you know where my keys are?	No. Im talking about your breakfast.
No. Im talking about your breakfast.	Did you try the rumpus room?
Im sorry, everybody. But Ive only got two cupcakes for the three of you.	Well, Mom, one of us has scarfed down more than enough cupcakes over the past three decades to keep him...
Just take mine. A simple cupcake will bring me no pleasure.	Oh yeah!
Every day at noon a bell rings and they herd us in here for feeding time. And we sit around like cattle, chewing our cuds, dreading the inevitable...	Food fight!
Come on, come on. Lets go.	In the red trunks, with a record of forty-eight wins and no losses, the undisputed champ of this house, Battling Bart Simpson. Whoopee! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! And in the lavender trunks, with a record of zero wins and forty-eight defeats -- oh, correction, humiliating defeats -- all of them by knockout...
Must you do this every time?	...Homer The Human Punching Bag Simpson. Boo! Boo! Hiss!
...Homer The Human Punching Bag Simpson. Boo! Boo! Hiss!	And Homer is down! Three seconds, folks -- a new record!
Okay. Here we go.	Yo, chump, you back again?
What did you do this time, you little hoodlum? Oop. Get out of the way.	I didnt do it. Nobody saw me do it. Theres no way they can prove anything.
No, Bart. This note isnt about you.	It isnt? There must be some mistake.
It isnt? There must be some mistake.	Hey, youre right. This notes about Lisa.
Thanks for knowing I mean well.	Gee, Homer. Looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands.
Youre right. Bart, vacuum this floor!	Hey, man, I didnt do anything wrong.
Stupid Homer... Thinks hes so big... Stupid Homer... Stupid Homer. Ill show him.	Enjoy your bath?
No. Not really.	Oh. Too bad. Well, I certainly had fun vacuuming. Maybe now Ill get the pleasure of scrubbing your tub.
So typical of Bart. All he thinks about is himself.	Hey, dont say stuff like that about me to Maggie. Shes on my side, anyway.
Is not.	Is, too.
Is not.	Is, too.
Is not.	Is, too. Watch, Ill prove it. Maggie, come to the one you love best.
No, Maggie! Come here, girl. Come to me.	Come on, Maggie. The choice is obvious.
All right Maggie, just go to Bart.	Exactly, come to the one you love.
Oh, no, come on! Dont let that boy -- get out of the... Oh, no, not again! Dont. Dont. Dont. Great, get over. Oh, geeze.	Gee, Dad, youre really bad at this.
What th...	Put up your dukes, Homer.
Bart, go easy on me. Im your Dad.	I am going easy on you, but youre just so old and slow and weak and pathetic.
I got a bratty brother / He bugs me every day / And this mornin my own mother, she gave my last cupcake away! / My Dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo / Im the sa...dest kid in grade number two.	Aw come on, Ill cheer you up.
Oh. Me, too.	Me three. What are we talking about?
Do you think youre being nice enough to your sister, Bart?	Oh, yeah. Easy.
You do love her, dont you?	Oh, Mom.
Well you do, dont you?	Dont make me say it. I know the answer, you know the answer, he knows the answer, lets just drop it. Okay?
Okay, Bart, you dont have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. Be nice to your sister.	Okey-dokey.
Yeah! Moes Tavern. Moe speaking.	Is Jacques there?
Who?	Jacques. Last name Strap.
I feel like smiling.	Im going to knock you out one more time and thats it. This is getting boring, man.
Just try not to kill me too hard, son. Heh-heh-heh.	Whoa!
Kid, tonights not your night.	All right, man. You asked for it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.
Oh! Oh! Block it.	Wha the...
Im sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game.	Youre right, Mom. Id just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing.
Howdy, Bart. Hot enough for ya?	Shut up, Flanders. Hey dad, how come we cant get a decent mower like the Flanders?
Shut up, Flanders. Hey dad, how come we cant get a decent mower like the Flanders?	No.
How do you like my new wheels, Simpson?	Wow, man! What an RV!
You can tell your son, it has its own satellite. The VanStar One launched last February, just for this thing. Thats all.	Oh man!
Jealous. Everybody ready?	I hate this. I dont want to go.
No.	Skunks?
No.	Slaughter house?
No.	No!
Were playing Whats that odor?.	Dads feet.
Lisa!	Are we there yet, dad?
Yes sir! This is a real adventure. Why, I bet there are people who would trade everything they have in the world for an adventure like this.	You mean like we just did?
Oh, I dont think theyll be gone long and shes in good hands, Lisa.	There arent any dangerous animals in this forest are there, Dad?
Well, might be a few. But dont worry about it. If you leave them alone, theyll leave you alone.	Its a deal.
And remember not to act afraid. Animals can smell fear. And they dont like it. Besides, theres nothing to be afraid of.	Right.
A rattler!	Im not afraid, Im not afraid, Im not...
Through here, boy. Back to civilization.	How do you know?
Bart! Oh Bart! Bart, Bart! Oh, Bart, my beautiful son. Why couldnt you have taken me? Of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me?	Dont have a cow, Dad.
What the--? Youre alive!... and... buck nekkid.	Im not the only one, Homeboy.
The first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy Conceal your nakedness.	Yeah, man.
Okay, slap a fern on there, boy. Now, some mud. There. Ooh! That requires a little mollusk. And mollusk for me. All right. Were ready to hit the town.	But dad, Im so hungry. Cant we eat something first? Im starving, man.
This young sapling ought to do the trick.	What are we going to do, hang ourselves?
Okay, okay. This time Ill just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. When he comes out, you step on him.	Right, Dad.
No.	Are we ever going to be there?
Honey! Honey! Were saved!	Uh Homer. Bees!
Uh Homer. Bees!	How is it?
Wah-neh! Wah-neh!	What?
Wah neh! Wah neh!	Oh. Water. Thattaway, man.
Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles. Nice grizzles.	What do we do, Dad?
Praise the grizzles son.	Nice grizzles.
Nice grizzly, nice grizzly.	Later, grizzly dudes.
Youre lucky we got here in time to rescue you.	What the hell are you talking about, sir?
Weve got to take him alive. Johnson, you got that tranquilizer gun ready?	Dad! Oh Dad!
Theyve got us cornered, boy. Well never get away. Give me the head.	No, dad. This whole thing was my fault. You run along.
Son, were in this mess together. No matter how tempting it might be, I cant let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob.	Aw, dad.
And his kid, Bart.	Murderous mob. I beg you to spare our lives. At least until youve heard the story of how we ended up with the head of our beloved town founder.
How long will this story take?	Ah... about twenty three minutes and five seconds.
Well, all right, go ahead.	Okay. It all started Sunday morning...
Cmon everybody, were late. Bart, I want you to promise me youll pay attention in Sunday school. Bart? Bart? BART!!	Whoa! Are you talking to me?
Whats this? A personal stereo? Were you going to listen to rock music in Sunday school?	Maybe.
The ventriloquist goes to heaven, but the dummy doesnt.	Oh, oh, oh, me.
Bart.	What about a robot with a human brain?
That was very nice father.	Hey, guys, whered you get all that great stuff?
The answers to deep theological questions..	Yeah. Among other things, apes cant get into heaven.
What! Those cute little monkeys? Thats terrible. Who told you that?	Our teacher.
I can understand how they wouldnt let in those wild jungle apes, but what about those really smart ones who live among us -- who roller skate and smoke cigars?	Ah, cool, man. Space Mutants 4. Drop me off! Drop me off!
I hope youre not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didnt want you to see?	Perish the thought.
Hey, hot dog!	What?
Nice dismount, man.	It didnt hurt.
Oh yeah? Well, do it again.	Nah. I might land on my face and end up lookin like you.
Hey man, leave the kid alone. I like him.	You do?
Yeah! Youre witty. So whats your name, man?	Im Bart Simpson.
This heres KEARNEY and Im Jimbo.	You dont need an introduction. Youre the worst kid in school.
Psst. Coast is clear.	You guys are sneakin in?
Hey Bart, come on.	But sneaking into a movie is practically stealing man.
It is stealing.	Well, okay. I just wanted to make sure we werent deluding ourselves.
You know, Bart, Ive been kicked out of all four space mutants movies.	Wow, man!
Four fifty-two.	Dont worry, guys. Its on me. Share the wealth, thats what I always say.
Dont worry, guys. Its on me. Share the wealth, thats what I always say.	Guys? Guys!
Guys? Guys!	You ripped it off?
Ugh! Go on, Bart.	But that guy founded Springfield. He built our first hospital out of logs and mud. If it werent for him all the settlers would have died in the great blizzard of forty eight.
So...?	So... watch me hit him right between the eyes.
Yeah! That one looks like a school bus going over a cliff in flames with kids inside screaming.	That one looks like the statue of our town founder, Jebediah Springfield.
Does not.	Does too. I mean without the head, of course.
I wish someone really would cut his ugly old head off.	You do?
Sure would cheese everybody off.	But guys, come on. Dont you remember history class? Jebediah once killed a bear with his bare hands.
Yeah. Hes your boyfriend.	Cmon guys, knock it off!
Beat it, Simpson. I thought you were cool.	Ah!
Now Ive seen everything. Black marbleized with a liquid center. The Stealth Bowler -- the pins dont know what hit em.	Dad, can I talk to you about something?
Sure, boy. Whats on your mind?	Well... I was wondering... how important is it to be popular?
Im glad you asked, son. Being popular is the most important thing in the world.	So like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better?
Youre not talking about killing anyone, are you?	No.
Are you?	No.
Bart, are you all right?	Oh yeah. Top of the world, Ma.
Ooooh, thats some ball.	G-o-o-o-d morning, everybody.
Stay tuned to this station for further developments as they break.	Its just a statue.
Just a statue? Is the Statue of Liberty just a statue? Is the Leaning Tower of Piza just a statue?	Uh-oh. School bus.
Uh-oh. School bus.	Cmon Lis. School bus.
Yeah, we wish he were here right now.	Oh, really?
Yeah, man.	What? But, but yesterday didnt you say it would be cool to cut off the head and really cheese everybody off?
Look what youve done. You want to be popular. Now youre the most hated boy in town.	Youre not really talking to me. Youre just my overactive imagination.
Oh, I am, am I?	Shut up... I wanted them to like me.
Hey Bart, where you going?	To my room.
Wait a minute. I hope youre not planning to do what I think youre doing.	Sorry, man. Its either you or me.
You know, Bart, you dont have to found a town to be a hero. Sometimes a hero can be a young boy with the courage to stand up and admit hes made a mistake.	Yeah, well Im running a little short on courage right now.
Along the way he met a ferocious bear and killed him with his bare thats b-a-r-e hands. Although modern historians recently uncovered evidence that the bear, in fact, probably killed him. But whether bear killed man, or man killed bear, a burgeoning town, Springfield, was born.	Mom, Dad.
Um-hm. Its an accident waiting to happen.	Cause I wanted some really bad kids to like me. Somehow I got the idea that being popular was the most important thing in the world.
We know this part.	Oh yeah, right...
Neither do I.	Dad?
Dad?	Forgive me, sir.
This is gonna be the best birthday breakfast Mom ever had.	Hey Lis, you think thats enough for her?
Do you know the Heimlich Maneuver?	Well, I know shell like mine. Who wouldnt like a bottle of real French perfume?
Well, I know shell like mine. Who wouldnt like a bottle of real French perfume?	All the way from Gay Paree. Four bucks, plus tax.
Well, I think shes gonna like my hand-made birthday card better.	Whoa, big deal... dry macaroni... spray paint and glue. Whoopee!
Dibs! First dibs, I get to lick the beaters.	Hep! Hep! Lisa! My ungue is stuck in the eater. Hep-hep!
No, Homer. Its mine.	You dont even know your own wifes birthday?
Of course I know! Sure! You really thought I forgot, didnt you?	Oh, right. Whatd you get her, Dad?
Whoa... hmmm. Thank you, Bart.	Youre welcome, Mom.
Wow!	Does not.
Does, too.	Does not.
Then how comes shes not putting on any of your perfume?	Yeah. Hey, Mom. How come youre not putting on any of my perfume?
Uh... I-Im saving it... for a special occasion.	What the hell are you talking about? Theres gallons of it.
But this occasion is already so special if we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special.	Gotcha. I told you she liked mine better.
Mm! Delicioso!	My compliments to the delivery boy.
Here you go, kids. Special lunches. Lots of good things for growing bodies and some treats just for fun.	Whoa. Aye carumba!
Hm, yes, I am, as a matter of fact. Heres more treats. But dont worry, your dad will take care of dinner.	Mmm. Wednesday -- hoagie night.
Oh, Bart, dont you see? This is what psychologists call over-compensation. Mom is racked with guilt because her marriage is failing.	Hey, dont rock the boat, man. Whatever it is, were making out like bandits.
Bart, I read about what happens to kids whose parents no longer love and cherish each other. They go through eight separate stages. Right now, Im in Stage Three, fear. Youre in Stage Two, denial.	No, Im not.
Yes, you are.	No, Im not.
Yes, you are.	Am not, am not, am not!
For Marge?	Hey, Dad. What do you say we toss the ol apple around, huh? Sound like fun?
Son, I dont know if I can lift my head, let alone a ball.	Aw, come on, Dad. Get the lead out.
Simpson checks the runner on first. Hes cool. Hes fine. Heres the windup and... heres the pitch.	Dad, you didnt even say ouch.
Oh, sorry... ouch!	Lisa, Lisa! I think youre right about Dad. Somethings very, very wrong here.
Frightened, Bart? Welcome to Stage Three Fear.	Well, come on. We gotta do something, man.
Sorry, Bart. Id love to help you but Im mired in Stage Five, self-pity.	Look, Dad. I dont know whats going on, but once you gave me some advice that might help.
I gave you advice? Get outta here.	Yeah. You did! You told me when somethings bothering you, and youre too damn stupid to know what to do, just keep your fool mouth shut. At least that way you wont make things worse.
Ah, baloney.	Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.	Oh, gimme a break.
Oh, gimme a break.	Wow! Cool, man!
Female carrier, Bart.	Lady, wheres my spy camera? Wheres my spy camera? Where is my spy camera, lady? Where is my spy camera? Wheres my spy camera? Wheres my spy camera?
Wheres my spy camera? Every day for the last six months. Wheres my spy camera? Wheres my spy camera? Wheres my spy camera? Heres your stupid spy camera!	Oh, thanks, man. Whoa, look at the size of this thing. I wonder if it really works.
Oh, thanks, man. Whoa, look at the size of this thing. I wonder if it really works.	...cause I got a lotta spyin to do.
Bart! What are you doing?	Sorry, Dad. The answer to that is top secret.
Bart.	What?
Mom, Bart was taking a picture of his butt.	Oh sure. Like Im really gonna take a picture of my butt.
Yay! Fried shrimp!	Aw, Mom. Cant we just grab a burger and... Only four of us? Who escaped?
Ahoy, I spy the childrens menu!	Ahoy, this place bites.
So, whats it gonna be, me little bucko?	Hmmmm... lets see. This evening I shall go for the squid platter.
Ewwwww!	Extra tentacles, please.
Yeah. Eat it, Bart.	May I please be excused for a minute?
Im sorry, I dont usually laugh like this.	Aye carumba!
We would like to welcome our new member, Bart Simpson.	Oh, people, people. Dont applaud. Lets get to work.
Whos the sexy lady, Bart?	Beats me, but the guy dancing with her is my Pop.
Bart, Id really appreciate a print of your masterwork.	Sorry guys. No can do.
Come on, Bart. Youre gonna make me a print, arent you?	Will you swear not to let another living soul get a copy of this photo?
Okay.	Cross your heart and hope to die?
Yep.	Stick a needle in your eye?
Yep.	Jam a dagger in your thigh?
Yep.	Eat a horse manure pie?
Yep.	Well, okay.
Hey, Bart, how come Milhouse gets a copy of your girlie picture and I dont? I thought I was your friend, too.	Well, okay.
Princess who?	Hey, my photo!
Your photo?	Uh oh.
Bart, go to your room!	Im outta here.
Hi, Daddy.	Welcome back, Dad.
Still kinda ticked off.	Yeah, good luck, man.
Princess Kashmir? You must mean April Flowers. Shes working over at the Girlesque.	Oooo.
You see, Im trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects.	Froggie, Im home.
Oh, okay, but can we make it quick?	Nice to meet you, maam.
IVE HEARD IT SAID SO OFTEN/ THEY COULDNT LOVE THEIR WIVES/ OH BUT I THINK THATS JUST FOOLISH/ MEN MUST HAVE HEARTS MADE OF STONE...	Cool, man.
Ahhhhhh!	Ooh! Ahh! Ooh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ohh!
Hes a love machine, sir.	Way to go dad!
Marge!	All right, folks shows over. No more to see, folks. Only sick people want to see my folks kiss.
Bart, if you had cleaned up your room when I asked you to, your fathers trick back would still be aligned. So you pick up this mess right now.	Clumsy Homer... Everythings always my fault... If hed just watch where he was going...
Clumsy Homer... Everythings always my fault... If hed just watch where he was going...	Hello.
Hello.	What have we here?
What have we here?	A cherry bomb! I thought I blew all you guys up.
Watch out, Bart. Its Skinner.	Uh-oh.
But he looks so sweet.	I am, maam.
Simpson! Lets move on now, Mother, shall we?	Bye, Spanky.
So, youre gonna flush it?	What can I say? I got a weakness for the classics.
Hello, Mrs. Simpson. Im afraid theres been a very disturbing incident at school today.	Im outta here, man.
Bart, how would you like to spend the next three months living in France?	France? Wow.
Mmm-hmm.	And Id get to take a plane there, wouldnt I, Mom?
Yes, Bart.	Wow. And one back?
Goodbye, my special, my special little guy. You will write us, wont you?	All the time.
What do you know about France?	I know Im going and youre not.
Im gonna miss you, son. And listen... while youre seeing all those great sights, always remember that youre representing your country. I guess what Im saying is, dont mess up France the way you messed up your room.	Okay, Dad.
Is one of you going to be on the charter flight?	Yes, sir.
Goodbye, Adil. Write us often.	Hey, man, watch it.
Hey, man, watch it.	Hey, man, its me, Bart Simpson.
Okay, kid, lets go.	Hey!
LITTLE BREEZE SEEMS TO WHISPER LOUISE / BIRDS IN THE TREES SEEM TO LOUISE / La la la la / La la la la Ooo la la... How much longer, sir?	This is where were going, right?
This is where were going, right?	Cha...teau Ma...son.
Ah, Maurice. Once the American boy gets here, your days of endless back-breaking labor will be over.	Ewww, what a dump.
Hes right, you know.	Well, okay, sir.
And a red hat for you, Maurice.	Hey, come on guys. Quit being so grabby.
Hey, come on guys. Quit being so grabby.	Sorry, man. Be my guest.
Yes, pass me the wine.	Can I have something to go with my turnip?
Now, go to sleep.	Hey! Hey! Come on. Move it, pal.
Dear Bart, How is France? I dont know why you havent written. I guess youre just having too much fun.	Yeah, right.
What are you doing? Get out of here.	Sorry.
Drink this.	Uh, no thanks.
Do not worry. This is France. It is customary for children to take a little wine now and then.	Yeah, but its got anti-freeze in there.
I am sorry. I do not speak English.	But you gotta help me. These two guys Im staying with, they work me day and night, they dont feed me, they make me sleep on the...
Here you go, little boy. Have a piece of candy. Tiens, petit garcon, voila un bonbon.)	I dont want a piece of candy, I need your hel--
I dont want a piece of candy, I need your hel--	Come on, mister. Can you help me?
I am sorry.	Aw, forget it. Im so stupid. Anybody could have learned this dumb language by now. Here Ive listened to nothing but French for the past deux mois, et je ne sais pas un mot. Eh! Mais, je parle francois maintenant. Incroyable!
Anti-freeze in the wine? That is a very serious crime. Come along, boy. There is nothing for you to fear now.	Mon sauveteur! Vous aurez toujours une place dans mon coeur!
And all because we participated in a student exchange program!	Au revoir, suckers.
Oh, Bart, my baby boy. Welcome home.	Hey, wheres the big guy?
He needs me. Hey, boy.	Hey, Homer.
Bart, I have something to say thats gonna bother me if I dont say it... Its good to see you.	Same here.
Sorry, Marge. Some wiseguy stuck a cork in the bottle.	My father. What a buffoon.
Sorry Sideshow Bob, but its her special birthday wish.	Youre doomed, Sideshow Bob.
I didnt do it!	Comedy, thy name is Krusty.
All this senseless violence. I dont understand its appeal.	We dont expect you to, Mom.
This is Selma taking a siesta.	Aye carumba!
Wait a minute. Bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?	Oh, you mean Krusty the Clown?
Hes sort of a hero of yours, isnt he?	Are you kidding? Hes my idol. Ive based my whole life on Krustys teachings.
Krusty the Clown is behind bars tonight after a daring twilight robbery of a local Kwik-E-Mart.	Krusty!
Hand over all your money in a paper bag.	Oh... oh! Krusty, how could you?
Youre my best friend.	Thanks, Krusty.
I didnt do it.	I wish I could believe you.
Will you plead insanity?	Look at him. His clothes are so drab.
His face is so flesh-colored and sad.	And his feet... theyre so small.
And his feet... theyre so small.	Say it aint so, Krusty.
I would like to call to the stand, Homer J. Simpson.	Dont do it, Dad. Please dont do it.
Dont do it, Dad. Please dont do it.	Hes innocent, I tell you. Krusty would never do something like that. Ah come on Dad, you gotta listen to me.
Okay.	Oh, man.
Is it a crime to be illiterate?	So?
So?	Yeah, Al. Last name, Koholic.
My young friends. For years I have been silent, save for the crude glissandos of this primitive wind instrument. But now destiny has thrust me into the center ring. In the coming weeks, you will notice some rather sweeping changes in our program. Please, do not be alarmed. Itchy and Scratchy will still have a home here, but we will also learn about nutrition, self-esteem, etiquette and all the lively arts.	What the hell are you doing, Lis?
Im watching Sideshow Bob. You know, hes a lot less patronizing than Krusty used to be.	You backstabber, you traitor, you...
Snap out of it, Bart. Face the facts. All those hours we spent staring at Krusty, we were staring at a crook.	Look, Lisa, I know Krustys innocent. Dont ask me why. Its just a feeling I have.
Oh, Bart.	Come on, Lisa. I think I can prove Krustys innocent, but I need your help.
You do? Why?	Oh, come on Lis, you know why.
No, why?	Ill never forgive you for making me say this, but... youre smarter than me.
Ill never forgive you for making me say this, but... youre smarter than me.	So, you with me?
Bart, look!	So? I dont have a pacemaker.
Dont you remember the get-well card we sent to Krusty? It was after his heart attack, when he had a pacemaker put in.	Ah ha!
Wait a minute. Krusty cant read.	Okay! okay! So the poor guy cant read! Cant we get off his back already?
Bart, Im starting to think youre right. Krusty was framed. Did he have any enemies?	I dont know, but I know someone who would Krustys best friend in the whole world, Sideshow Bob.
Certainly. I take great pride in being able to sign my own name.	Sideshow Bob, can we ask you a few--
Forgive me, children. As much as Sideshow Bob would love to chat, he has a show starting in moments. Here you go. Three tickets, be my guest.	Well, okay, but...
With all our hearts!	About a zillionth as much as I love Krusty.
Whats your name, young man?	Bart Simpson, sir.
Mmm... Well, perhaps we can shed some light on your problem in a new segment exploring pre-adolescent turmoil. I call it Choices.	I dont think so, sir.
So whats on your mind, Bart? I bet the other children dont accept you.	True, Sideshow Bob, but that doesnt bother me. You see, my sisters and I have been doing a little investigating, and it looks to us like Krusty was framed.
Framed?	Well, the videotape showed that the thief used the microwave oven at the Kwik-E-Mart. But Krusty couldnt go near the thing. Not with his pacemaker.
Well, you know Bart, as much as I love Krusty, he was never one to take doctors orders too seriously.	Well, maybe. But, get this, Krusty was illiterate and the guy who robbed the store was reading the Springfield Review of Books.
Review of Books. Just look at these amusing caricatures of Gore Vidal and Susan Sontag.	Yeah, I guess those are kinda funny.
Bart, children, this whole sordid affair has been a shock to all of us, but we must get on with our lives. Lets try to remember Krusty not as a hardened criminal, but as that lovable jester who honked his horn and puttered around in his little car.	And shot you out of a cannon.
You know, in ancient Greece, there was a school of thought called stoicist...	Wait a minute! You did it!
Excuse me?	Attention, fellow children. Krusty didnt rob that store. Sideshow Bob framed him and I got proof.
Ow, my foot, you lousy, stupid, clumsy...	See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes but hes got little feet, like all good-hearted people.
See that? Krusty wore big floppy shoes but hes got little feet, like all good-hearted people.	Sideshow Bob really fills his shoe with big ugly feet.
Yes, I admit it. I hated him. His hackneyed shenanigans robbed me of my dignity for years. I played the buffoon while he squandered a fortune on his vulgar appetites. Thats why I framed Krusty. I would have gotten away with it too if it werent for these meddling kids.	Take him away, boys.
Well, the important thing is that I regained the trust of the children, but there was one boy who trusted me all along. Bart?	Yes, sir.
Awww, Dad.	Awww... Homer!
Uh-oh, school bus.	Hey, cool your jets, man. Were comin!
Oh, come on, Bart, not again.	Aw, wheres your sense of humor?
Moes Tavern.	Hello, is Al there?
Wow, a quarter past six. Whats keeping Dad?	Yeah, whod possibly be late on meat loaf night?
Hey, Mom.	How bout some grub?
Moes Tavern.	Is Oliver there?
Who?	Oliver Klozoff.
BA, BA / BA BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA BA, BA, BA...	Work that body, Homer.
You know, one day youll learn to move like your old man.	Not if I can help it.
Son, theres not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo.	You dont have a clue, do you, Dad?
Out, boy, out.	What a grump.
Oh, boy, The Happy Little Elves Meet The Curious Bear Cub!	Oh, the Elves, the Elves!
Come, children, lets go watch the Happy Little Elves.	Look, lady, weve seen the Crappy Little Elves about fourteen billion times. Maybe we can watch some real TV.
I said were gonna watch the tape.	Awww, thats merely suggested viewing matter, lady. Mom lets us watch whatever the hell we want.
Weve got to save Bubbles!	Oh, man, I cant take it anymore.
Bart, youre just like Chilly, the elf who cannot love.	Now for some real TV.
Now for some real TV.	All right! Americas Most Armed and Dangerous.
Oh, no, Bart, well have nightmares.	Relax. This is cinema verite. When the brutal slow-motion killing starts, Ill tell you to shut your eyes.
The Babysitter Bandit has left a trail of her daring nighttime robberies across the continental United States. She could be lurking anywhere, about to descend upon another house full of unsuspecting dupes.	Wow.
Oh, homemade pickled beets.	Go ahead. Take em all.
Go ahead. Take em all.	The thing is no one was hurt. I think it would be really silly to dwell on this.
He isnt.	Youre crazy if you think youre gonna get away with this, lady. You cant --
We caught her! We caught the Babysitter Bandit! Shes tied up at our house right now!	Ask if theres a reward!
Is there a reward? If shes convicted, we get T-shirts.	Yeah!
Aint that the truth. You know, one time he --	This way to the scene of the crime, men. Ive got her tied up in the den.
Uh... uh... no. Are you sure this microphone works? Uh, well, I wouldnt say I aided her. This is on, right? Because, actually, it was quite a struggle.	Awww, Homer.
Oh please, call me Papa.	Little ketchup for your buns, Papa?
Is it ready? Ha, what a question. Fellow students, prepare to be dazzled. Well, as Mrs. Krabappel already mentioned, the name of the book that I read was Treasure Island.	Its about these pirates. Pirates with patches over their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... and green birds on their shoulders...
Its about these pirates. Pirates with patches over their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... and green birds on their shoulders...	Did I mention this book was written by a guy named Robert Louis Stevenson? And published by the good people at McGraw Hill.
Did I mention this book was written by a guy named Robert Louis Stevenson? And published by the good people at McGraw Hill.	So in conclusion, on the Simpsons scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, one being the lowest, and five being average, I give this book... a nine.
So in conclusion, on the Simpsons scale of one to ten, ten being the highest, one being the lowest, and five being average, I give this book... a nine.	Any questions?
Any questions?	No? Then Ill just sit down.
No? Then Ill just sit down.	Mrs. Krabappel, I am insulted. Is this a book report or a witch hunt?
Blackbeard... Captain Nemo... Captain Hook... Long John Silver... Peg Leg Pete... Bluebeard.	Bluebeard?
Blah, blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?	Yes, maam.
Blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah blah!...	Yes, maam.
Yes, maam.	Yes, maam.
Yes, maam.	Uhhh... straighten up and fly right?
Whoa, take that, Granny! Oh, hide in the closet. Oh no, deadly mothballs.	Ooo... Granny killing me!
You have reached the level of ungrateful grandchild. Try again, if you dare! Heh... heh... heh...	Heh... heh... heh. Just a couple more games and Ill hit the books.
Eww, I hate that icky soup skin.	Okay, right after dinner, its down to business.
Im just gonna take this over to the refrigerator and, hmmm. Well as long as Im here, I might as well kill two birds with one stone.	Whats the big idea? You covered up my paper.
Look at those funny little whiskers. Oooo! That reminds me. Its Big Gorilla Week on Million Dollar Movie. Cmon boy.	No, Dad, I should really... Whoop!
Oooh, Gorilla, The Conqueror. The granddaddy of them all.	Ah well, maybe just one more hour.
Its so unfair... just because hes different.	Well, time to hit the books.
Bart, honey... youre going to miss your bus!	Uh-oh.
Hey, Bart-dude. Whoa, you look freaked.	Hey, Otto-man. Ive got a big test that I am not ready for. Could you please crash the bus or something?
Oh, sorry little buddy. Cant do it on purpose. But hey, maybe youll get lucky.	Okay, no reason to panic. Find an egghead, pump him for some answers, and boom, Im back on easy street.
Hes pathetic.	Good morning, girls.
Good morning, Bart.	Say... whos up for a little cram session? Ill go first. What was the name of the pilgrims boat?
The Spirit of St. Louis.	And where did they land?
Sunny Acapulco.	Whyd they leave England?
Giant rats.	Cool. Historys coming alive.
As a natural enemy, I dont know why I should care, but the information pertaining to Americas colonial period that you just received is erroneous.	So youre saying...
A blindfolded chimp with a pencil in his teeth has a better chance of passing this test than you do.	Thanks for the pep talk.
Oh! Ooooo!!	Nothing... must... take... test.
Whats the matter, son?	Sharp, stabbing pains... in my stomach.
Do you feel a shooting pain in your arm?	Both arms, maam.
Temporary loss of vision?	Who said that? Come closer.
Yes, dear?	Uh maybe... uh, one more dish. Make it double cappuccino chocolate fudge.
Oooh, your third bowl... I think you may be on the mend. Is there anything else I can get you?	Hmmm, perhaps the TV?
Everyone knows youre faking it, Bart.	Well, everyone better keep their mouths shut.
Youre gonna have to fail that history test sooner or later.	Ive got my bases covered.
Ive got my bases covered.	Hey Milhouse, what did I miss in school today?
Nothing much. Lewis made Richard laugh milk through his nose.	Oh, you dont say? What about that history test?... Huh? Piece of cake, huh? So listen, whatd you get for Number one? Uh huh. Number two?... Oh yeah, that sounds right.
Hmmmm	No.
Every other student in the class has shown at least some form of improvement and yet you continue to struggle. Why is that?	I dunno.
I dunno.	Okay... okay! Why are we dancing around the obvious? I know it. You know it. I am dumb. Okay? Dumb as a post. Do you think Im happy about it?
Oh... I wish it were that simple. As shameful and as emotionally crippling as it may be, Im afraid my recommendation is for Bart Simpson to repeat the fourth grade.	What! You cant hold me back. Ill do better, I promise.
Well, maybe it would help him to be left back. It wont be so bad, Bart.	No, I mean it. You cant hold me back. I swear Im gonna do better. Look at my eyes. See the sincerity, see the conviction, see the fear. As God is my witness, I can pass the fourth grade.
Get off the bus or forever hold your peace, little dudes.	Otto, you know I respect you. I mean you always let us throw stuff at cars and try to tip the bus on sharp turns...
So whats in your head, little man?	Well, Ive been failing a lot of tests recently.
Yuh huh.	And now theyre talking about holding me back in the fourth grade if I dont shape up.
Long John Silver, Dad.	Thanks a lot, son.
Yo! Little help!	I said little help! Throw me the ball, Poindexter.
Well, back to the forecastle of the Pequod.	Hm, hey, Martin.
You have your ball back. I have nothing else of value.	I need you to help me get a passing grade.
Well, you do need someones help to get a passing grade but I dont know why that someone should be me.	Because I can make it so the other kids dont laugh at you so much.
They... laugh at me? Id always considered myself rather popular.	Youre not. Watch!
Then my-my speed with numbers... my years of service as a hall monitor... my prize winning diaramas... these things mean nothing to them?	Perhaps another demonstration.
Very well. You have made your point, Bart.	Then its a deal.
All righty. Lets have a look-see at your study area.	Study area?
Yes, your-your sanctuary from the hurly-burly of modern life.	Well, theres a desk under that junk over there.
No?	Only geeks sit in the front seat. From now on you sit in the back row. And thats not just on the bus. It goes for school and church, too.
Why?	So no one can see what youre doing.
Oooh. I think I understand. The potential for mischief varies inversely with ones proximity to the authority figure.	Well yeah, but dont say it like that.
Who would have thought that pushing a boy into the girls lavatory could be such a thrill? The screams, the humiliation, the fact that it wasnt me. Ive never felt so alive.	Great, Martin. Now, the big test is tomorrow and I havent even started to study...
Who cares about some test? Lifes too short for tests.	Hey! I thought we had a deal.
Bart, its past your bedtime.	Okay.
Okay.	This is hopeless.
This is hopeless.	Well, old timer... I guess this is the end of the road. I know I havent always been a good kid. But if I have to go to school tomorrow, Ill fail the test and be held back. I just need one more day to study, Lord. I need your help.
Prayer, the last refuge of a scoundrel.	A teachers strike, a power failure, a blizzard. Anything thatll cancel school tomorrow. I know its asking a lot, but if anyone can do it, you can. Thanking you in advance, your pal, Bart Simpson.
Wake up Bart, rise and shine, little guy. Time to wake up.	Oh? No, no.
Wake up and look at the snow.	Huh? Whoa, Good morning, world!
Oh, oh! Springfield County Schools will be closed.	Please please please please please please please. All right!
Remember to take a break if your arms go numb!	Hey.
I heard you last night, Bart. You prayed for this. Now your prayers have been answered. Im no theologian. I dont know who or what God is exactly. All I know is Hes a force more powerful than Mom and Dad put together and you owe him big.	Youre right. I asked for a miracle and I got it. I gotta study, man.
GONE AWAY IS THE BLUEBIRD / HERE TO STAY...,gone away is the bluebird here to stay,8	Gotta study! Gotta study! Gotta study!
That all men are created equal.	That all men are created equal.
Later, Mrs. K.	Do you think you could grade it now, please?
Do you think you could grade it now, please?	Oh no, I cant believe it.
Oh no, I cant believe it.	No, you dont understand. I really tried this time. I really tried.
No, you dont understand. I really tried this time. I really tried.	This is as good as I can do. And I still failed.
This is as good as I can do. And I still failed.	Who am I kidding? I really am a failure. Oh, now I know how George Washington felt when he surrendered Fort Necessity to the French in 1754...
Who am I kidding? I really am a failure. Oh, now I know how George Washington felt when he surrendered Fort Necessity to the French in 1754...	Oh you know... 1754, the famous defeat to the French...
Oh you know... 1754, the famous defeat to the French...	So...
You mean I passed?	I passed. I got a D minus. I passed. All right!
Were proud of you boy.	Thanks, Dad. But part of this D minus belongs to God.
Bismarck.	Hitler?
Louder!	It is.
Its gotta be a fake!	Its like, realsville, Daddy-o.
Bart, what are you doing?	Uh-oh.
Why you little...	Uh-oh.
Boy must die.	I love you, Dad.
... and the policeman on the other end of the phone said, We have traced the call. Its coming from the floor below you. Get out of the house! But it was too late. End of story.	Yawn. I heard that when I was in the third grade. Its not scary.
Is too.	Is not.
Is too.	Is not.
Is too.	Is not.
Fine. Then you tell one scarier.	Flashlight, please.
Flashlight, please.	Heres a story thats really scarifying.
Oh, brother.	I call it Bad Dream House.
Ow! Mom! Bart threw a book at me.	Did not.
Did too.	Did not.
Quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.	Mom! Dad! Help!
They are all against you, Bart. You must kill them all. They all must die.	Are you my conscience?
Its an ancient Indian burial ground.	Man, this place has got everything!
Not to worry. Ill just turn on the trusty bug zapper.	Do you get HBO?
Better than your eyes bursting. Ewww!	Do it again.
What?	Make the walls bleed.
No.	Hey, man. We own you. Lets see some blood.
I dont have to entertain you.	Come on man, do it! Do the blood thing! Come on, do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
Wow!	Bitchin!
That wasnt scary at all, Bart.	Oh, yeah? Well how about... this severed finger!
Oh, yeah? Well how about... this severed finger!	Eww, baby spit.
Heh... heh... heh.	Well that last story was just a warm-up for this macabre tale, which I call, Hungry Are The Damned.
That should just about do it. Man alive, theres nothing better than a hamburger grilled to perfection...	Cool man!
I am actually speaking Rigelian. By an astonishing coincidence, both of our languages are exactly the same.	Well, what are you gonna do with us, man?
Fried shrimp.	Sloppy Joes!
And over here is our crowning achievement in amusement technology. An electronic version of what you call table tennis. Your primitive paddles have been replaced by an electronic...	Hey, thats just Pong!
Hey, thats just Pong!	Get with the times, man.
Lisa, see what we mean when we say youre too smart for your own good?	Way to go, Lis.
Hello, something scary happening.	Hey, Poindexter. Its Halloween, put the book away.
For your information, Im about to read you a classic tale of terror by Edgar Allan Poe.	Wait a minute. Thats a schoolbook.
Darkness there and nothing more.	You know what would have been scarier than nothing?
What?	Anything!
Quoth the Raven,	Eat my shorts!
Bart! Stop it. He says nevermore. Thats all hell ever say.	Okay, okay.
Come back here now, Raven	Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore. Nevermore.
Well, it was written in 1845. Maybe people were easier to scare back then.	Well yeah, like when you look at Friday The 13th, Part I, its pretty tame by todays standards.
Children, bedtime.	I guess Ill have no trouble gettin to sleep tonight.
I see. And uh, whats your name, son?	Im Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Im Dave Shutton. Im an investigative reporter whos on the road a lot, and uh, I must say that in my day we didnt talk that way to our elders.	Well, this is my day and we do, sir.
Well, this is my day and we do, sir.	All right! We eat tonight!
Try not to spill anything, Dad.	Keep those mutants comin, Homer.
Were gonna send - a message - to those bureaucrats - down there in the State Capital!	Is your boss Governor yet?
And some reporters and camera crews, but you dont need to feed them.	Cool man! A media circus.
Kids, please leave the room. I dont want you to see this.	Uh oh.
The latest polls are in. Its dead even -- fifty-fifty. This cornball stunt is gonna put us over the top.	Whoa! Hes here!
Bart, would you like to say grace?	Dear God, we paid for all this stuff ourselves, so thanks for nothin.
...some cant even get a fair shake, or even a square deal... Ummmm, smells delightful.	All right! Three eyed fish!
Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled.	Uh oh. Youre busted, Dad.
You know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day.	What? Arent we gonna see any washed-up major leaguers?
Oh, wow -- theres Flash Bailor! I gotta get his autograph! He used to be a star!	Hey, Flash! Will ya sign my ball?
No.	Lousy, washed-up, broken-down... old tub of guts... who does he think he is anyway...
Whats the matter, boy?	He wouldnt sign my ball.
Here you go, Bart.	Hmmm, Springfield Kozy Kort Motel, Room 26... How bout it? -- Flash.
One hocker coming up, sir.	What a lame-o!
Hey, Burns! Hey, Rag Arm!	You throw like my sister, man!
Lets go now... Sa-winggg, batter!	We want a pitcher / Not a belly itcher!
Well, Im ready to punch in.	Oh, oh. Hey, cool, man.
It wont be so bad. Youll die someplace else.	Well, what am I supposed to do about friends?
Lets do it, Homer!	Yeah, lets blow this pop stand and never look back.
I dont know, Bart. I mean, Im gonna miss you and all, but...	Come on, Milhouse. This way well be friends forever.
Ewww!	Im gonna miss you, spit brother.
Look! The Crosstown Bridge!	Wow!
Lets see. Upper, upper, upper mezzanine. Hmmm. Yes, these must be ours.	These seats stink!
But they didnt care.	Whats with these people? Why are they sitting on their hands?
Now, now, Homer. Barts busy working on his science project.	You heard the lady, Homer. So please mow quietly. Genius at work.
Homie, quit tossing.	Play it where it lays, Homer.
Neighbors forever. Oh, no! Ned Flanders.	What a sap!
Now, just a minute.	Bosom!
Bart!	Huh?
Okay, okay, all right, all right. Shes right! Lets do something together. What does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?	All right!
Fore!	Heh, heh, heh heh...
That was just a practice shot, boy.	Give up, Homeboy. Theres a six-stroke limit.
Hi, Bart!	Get bent.
Luck.	Final score Bart, forty-one. Homer... lets see, six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six...
Wow! First prize, fifty dollars!	Wow! Free balloons for everyone who enters!
Yeah, hes entering and whats more, hes going to win, arent you, boy?	I guess its possible.
Come on, boy.	But Dad, Ive never won anything in my life.
Okay, that didnt work. This time move your head and dont follow through.	Oh, man.
Whatre you doing? That putter is to you what a bat is to a baseball player, what a violin is to the guy tha...the violin guy. Now, cmon, give your putter a name.	What?
Come on, give it a name.	Mr. Putter.
Do you wanna try a little harder, son? Come on, give it a girls name.	Mom.
Your putters name is Charlene!	Why?
Now, this is a picture of your enemy, Todd Flanders. Every day I want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and Charlene annihilate him.	Whos Charlene?
Hi, Bart. Whatre you doing?	Lis, what do you call those guys in chess that dont matter?
Lis, what do you call those guys in chess that dont matter?	Absolutely. Eeeeeeeer!
Well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but I think youre referring to a pawn.	Right. I am a pawn.
And, finally, the most important book of all, The Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu.	Lisa, we cant afford all these books.
I want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.	Okay.
Embrace nothingness.	You got it.
Become like an uncarved stone.	Done.
Bart! Youre just pretending to know what Im talking about.	True.
Well, its very frustrating.	Ill bet.
Bart, I have a riddle for you Whats the sound of one hand clapping?	Piece of cake.
No, Bart. Its a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer. Its supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought.	No answer? Lisa, listen up.
But Bart, how can a sound exist if theres no one there to hear it?	Woooooooo!
The basis of this game seems to be simple geometry. All you have to do is hit the ball here.	I cant believe it... Youve actually found a practical use for geometry.
Look, son, all Im asking is that you try.	Okay, Ill try.
Eighth hole.	Aim for the Octopus third tentacle.
Twelfth hole.	Bank it off the pink tombstone.
Nirvana.	A state of bliss attained through the extinction of the self.
Bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself, Im not sure how theyre supposed to sound. But here goes. I believe in you.	Thanks, man!
Its got a chance... Yes, sir!	Oh, man...
Oh, man...	Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in the woods. Tree falling in...
Neither man showing his best form... This sort of pressure can unhinge even the steeliest of competitors.	This is pretty tense, isnt it, Todd?
Yeah, my knees are shaking, Ive got butterflies in my stomach... but I guess this builds character.	Who wants to build character. Lets quit.
We decided were equally good.	We want to call it a draw, man.
You will forgive an old Brit for crying, but this is the most stirring display of gallantry and sportsmanship since Mountbatten gave India back to the Punjabs.	Put her there, man!
Bart! Stop fighting with your sister!	She took my glue!
Dad, this isnt about glue. Its about territoriality. He only wants the glue because Im using it.	Oh yeah? Prove it!
Here.	Hey, man, I dont want your stupid glue.
Whatre you talking about, Bill?	Who the hell is that?
Bullwinkle.	Who? Wait a minute, whos that?
Underdog! Dont you know anything?	Well, I know it wouldnt hurt em to use some cartoons made in the last fifty years.
Honey, please. Youre in the way.	Cant I help you, Mom?
Well, okay. Lets see... Can you do the cranberry sauce?	Yeah! Where is it?
The can is in the cupboard on the bottom shelf.	Here?
No, no, no, the other shelf.	Got it. Now what?
Open the can.	No problemo. Wheres the can opener?
No, no, no, no, the other one.	Oh, I got ya.
Oh, I got ya.	Its broken, Mom. Mom, its broken. Mom, its broken. Mom, its broken. Mom, its broken. Mom, its broken.
Here you go.	Ah, cranberry sauce Ã  la Bart.
Homer, shouldnt you go pick up Grampa?	Yeah.
I couldnt tell you how many hours. It was a labor of love. Its my homage to some American heroes who may not have fought in any wars, but who nevertheless...	Da da daah da da dah daaahhh...
Speaking of heroes, heres mine... Tom Turkey!	Yikes! What is that?
Its the centerpiece, Bart!	Well, its taking up valuable real estate.
Hey, Bart, stop it!	Move it or lose it, toots!
Hey! That got er goin!	Bitchin!
All right, Bart thats it! Go to your room NOW!	Okay. Ill take some white meat and stuffing to go... and, send up the pumpkin pie in about twenty minutes.
Yes, you do! I hope youre happy, Bart! Youve RUINED THANKSGIVING!	I didnt ruin Thanksgiving! She did... Buncha jerks... I always get blamed for everything...
Okay, out you go!	Hey boy, come here! Youre a good dog! Come on, we dont need them to get a Thanksgiving dinner!
Mmmm. Stay here, boy.	Uh-oh!
Dont worry, boy. Well get some grub. Even if we have to pay for it.	Cool! The wrong side of the tracks.
Hey, you gotta be eighteen to sell your blood. Lets see some I.D.	Here you go, doll face.
Hmmm... Okay, Homer, just relax.	Ow.
Son, your family may be watching, is there anything youd like to say?	Yes, there is, Kent. Ha! Ha! I didnt apologize!
Hey, you got some place to sleep tonight, Bart?	Yeah, theres this family I kind of hang out with.
Sounds pretty sweet.	Yeah, I guess it is.
See you at Christmas.	A...listen, guys I was thinking, uh... unless youd feel weird about taking money from a kid...I thought maybe...
Marge, are we ever gonna see him again?	Hmmm... should I... or shouldnt I...
Hmmm... should I... or shouldnt I...	Hey, everybody. Im home.
Bart, isnt there something youd like to say to your sister?	Okay. Im sorry, too.
Yeah, beg me, Bart. Beg me!	Lisa, I beg of you. Please forgive me.
Its your fault Im bald!	Im sorry.
Its your fault Im old!	Im sorry.
Its your fault America has lost its way.	Im sorry. Im sorry.
Im sorry. Im sorry.	Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry...
Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry, Im sorry...	Im sorry all right! Sorry I came back here!
Im sorry all right! Sorry I came back here!	Aha.
Aha.	Whoa!!
Whoa!!	My wiffle balls, my frisbees, my water rockets... Ive hit the jackpot!
My wiffle balls, my frisbees, my water rockets... Ive hit the jackpot!	A sellout crowd at the Super Bowl, Simpson down by six with two seconds left! Simpson fades back. Hes got Simpson in the open...
A sellout crowd at the Super Bowl, Simpson down by six with two seconds left! Simpson fades back. Hes got Simpson in the open...	Touchdown, Simpson! The boy nobody wanted just won the Superbowl!!!
Dear Log, my brother is still missing, and maybe its my fault because I failed to take his abuse with good humor. I miss him so much already, that I dont know...	Hey, Lis! Lisa! Its me, Bart!
Bart...?! Where are you?	Shh! Im on the roof!
Bart, what are you doing up here? Everybodys worried.	Really? Did they cry?
Yes.	Bulls-eye!
Bart, why did you burn my centerpiece?	Ah, come on...
Was it because you hate me, or because youre bad?	I dont know! I dont know why I did it! I dont know why I enjoyed it! And I dont know why Ill do it again!
Just tell me youre sorry.	Why should I?
Bart, the only reason to apologize is if you look deep down inside yourself and you find a spot, something you wish wasnt there, because you feel bad you hurt your sisters feelings.	Leave me alone!
Just look!	Okay... okay.
Okay... okay.	Hmmm, hmmm. Looking for the spot... Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm... Still checking. This is so stupid... Im not gonna find anything... Just because I wrecked something she worked really hard on and I made her cr... Uh-oh!
Hmmm, hmmm. Looking for the spot... Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm... Still checking. This is so stupid... Im not gonna find anything... Just because I wrecked something she worked really hard on and I made her cr... Uh-oh!	Im sorry, Lisa.
And the challenger, from the University of Heidelburg, Professor Werner Von Brawn. Thats Brawn with a W.	Two titans at the height of their careers. Ah, if you ask me, this is going to be one hell of a match.
Rasputin is spinning the Professor like an auto gyro! Thats got to be disorienting!	Hey, Milhouse, crank it up.
Hey, thats my seat.	Correction, was your seat.
Ill be playing my first solo. If you miss it on Saturday, Id advise you to start looking for a child therapist on Sunday.	But Truckasaurous is one night only!
Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.	Faster, Dad. Truckasaurous awaits.
What?	Truckasaurous!
On the chance that I dont survive, let me just say, seat belts save lives so buckle up.	This is so cool.
Oh I cant watch.	He made it!
He made it!	Bitchin!
Bart, Bart. Were home, son.	Dad, I want to be a daredevil.
Youre never gonna make it.	Spare me your lectures, ladies.
Spare me your lectures, ladies.	Oof!
Are you all right?	Better than all right, I got stitches.
Ewwww.	Probably a scar, too.
Mrs. Simpson, Bart tells me he injured himself training for a career in death defiance?	Hey, Otto! Can I use that microphone?
Amen! Well, Bart, has Dr. Hibbert made his point?	He certainly has, Dad. I learned a real lesson here today. Thank you. Dr. Hibbert.
Oh man, youre the king.	Thank you. How bout a hand for these brave little animals?
Whats the matter, Bart?	Im runnin on empty, Milhouse. You kids get a kick out of my jumps, and I love you for it, but its all too easy.
Im runnin on empty, Milhouse. You kids get a kick out of my jumps, and I love you for it, but its all too easy.	Theres got to be a challenge out there worthy of me.
Hello, children, and welcome to Springfield Gorge.	Wow!!
Man, this things pretty gnarly. I bet you could throw a dead body in there, and no oned ever find it.	Otto, Im gonna leap over Springfield Gorge on my skateboard.
You know, Bart, as the only adult here, I feel I should say something.	What?
Stop!	But I want to tell them about my jump.
Oh, okay.	May I have you attention, please. This Saturday I will be jumping over Springfield Gorge on my skateboard. There is a good possibility I will plunge to my bloody death. Hope to see you there, thank you.
Springfield Gorge? Bart, youll be killed!	Lisa, I dont know how to explain this, but I get the same thrill out of jumping over stuff that you do from... reading.
Lance, this is Lisa and Bart Simpson. Bart is one of your biggest fans.	Its an honor, Lance. How you feeling?
Who should I make this out to?	Just Bart will be fine, sir.
To Bart Thanks for visiting me at Springfield General Hospital. Your visit was a ray of sunshine on an otherwise cloudy day. Your pal, Captain Lance Murdock.	Wow, man! Thanks, Lance.
Could you leave me with the younguns, please?	Whats the matter?
You didnt mean that. Bart, this isnt one of those phoney-baloney promises I dont expect you to keep. If you make this promise, you have to keep it.	Why?
But Captain Murdock!	Thanks, Lance.
Springfield Gorge? I thought we settled this daredevil junk.	Squealer.
Im sorry, Bart. But if you got hurt or died, despite the extra attention Id receive, Id miss you.	Bart, I forbid you to jump over that gorge.
Bart, I forbid you to jump over that gorge.	You cant.
I can and do. Go to your room, Bart! There, Ive done it. Im glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all.	Hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but theres no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. And the minute your back is turned, Im grabbing my skateboard and headin for that gorge.
Bart! What are you doing?	Ah, nothing.
You were on your way to jump the gorge, werent you?	Maybe.
Look, I know I cant stop you. The only thing I can do is ask you to promise me you wont jump the gorge.	Okay, I promise.
Cause if you dont, Ill never believe anything you say, ever again.	Aw, come on.
I mean it, boy.	Well, okay, Dad. I promise. I will not jump Springfield Gorge.
BART!	Hey, what gives?
Boy, Ive tried ordering you, Ive tried punishing you, and God help me, I even tried reasoning with you, and the only thing left for me to do is for me to jump the gorge myself.	What? Why?
Because that way youll see what its like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.	But, Dad, youll never make it.
Goodbye, son.	Wait, dad. Dont do it. I wont jump anymore, I promise.
Ohhh, thank God. Thank God. Thank God.	I love you, Dad.
Hey, kids! I spy Itchy and Scratchy off the port bow!	Hey, down in front!
But, Mom! If you take our cartoons away, well grow up without a sense of humor and be robots.	Really? What kind of robots?
I heard about the cartoons. Tough break, man.	Thanks, Nelson.
Hey, what if you watch Itchy and Scratchy over at my house?	Hey... Thats just crazy enough to work.
Ohhh.	That reminds me. Ive gotta get over to Milhouses and... uh... play sports.
We will.	Oh, oh, baby!
I didnt know they still made TV dinners this bad.	After dinner, can I watch cartoons?
Theres peas everywhere.	Oop, I guess Ill just go and watch some cartoons.
No. Im sorry about the dinners. Ill make up for it tomorrow night.	Hey, whos up for some cartoons?
No one.	All right.
Hiya.	Me and the guys went fishing. Almost caught a catfish this big.
Its a tool that every home handyman needs. Its a jigsaw! Its a power drill! Its a wood-turning lathe!	Borrowed?
Its time for Krusty.	You mean we can watch cartoons again, Mom?
All right!	Turn it up!
I think it conveys a very nice message of sharing.	I think it sucks.
Arent you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?	Nah. Come on, Lis.
Thats nice dear.	Come on, Lis. Lets go finish our soapbox racers.
Please hold on to the handrail. Do not spit over the side. Por favor, aguantese en la baranda. No escupas en los lados.	Great Grandpa Simpson!
Great Grandpa Simpson!	Snowball!
Howdy, stranger.	Im Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?
Ah, please allow me to introduce myself. Im the DEVIL! And youve earned eternal damnation for your lifetime of evil deeds, Bart. Spitting off the escalator just clinched it.	Hey, Im innocent, man!
Bart! Bart!	Um... say... is there anything I can do to avoid coming back here?
Goodbye Bart! Remember Lie, cheat, steal and listen to heavy metal music!	Yessir!
Oh, Bart! We thought for a minute youd gone away from us.	I did go away, Mom! I was miles and miles and miles away, writhing in agony in the pits of Hell. And you were there! And you! And you! And you! You Ive never seen before.
Hello, Lisa. Well, weve got a nasty bump on our head, havent we?	Ow! Quit it!
And a little tiny broken toe.	Ow! Quit it!
No, of course youre not going to die. Everythings fine!	Will I ever play baseball again?
No!	But I played baseball this morning!
Now, lets pretend youre on the witness stand... ...How are you, Bart?	Fine.
Oh, fine. Isnt that nice? Bart says hes fine. Wrong!!! You are not fine! You are in constant pain!	I am in constant pain.
Yeah, but what is truth -- if you follow me. Now, Bart, can you roll your eyes back in your head like this?	Ah, you mean like Im dead? Yeah, sure.
Hello, Bart. Now, you know the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie, dont you, son?	Maybe.
Uh-huh. Well, you wouldnt lie to the United States, would you, Bart?	No.
No.	Yes, sir. It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon. I was playing in my wholesome childlike way, little realizing that I was about to be struck down by the Luxury Car of Death.
No, thank you.	You know what wouldve really been cool? If we got that million bucks.
Bart, please.	What? We could have bought tons of great stuff, Mom... maids, a pool, fancy sweaters... stop me if Im wrong.
Theres that new sushi restaurant on Elm Street.	Sushi? Hey, maybe this is just one of those things you hear on the playground... but, isnt that raw fish?
Make it two.	Akira, my good man, Id like two sharks, an octopus and an eel.
Very good.	Do you have any giant squid? The kind that drags men to their deaths?
Youre the doctor!	WHOS THE BLACK PRIVATE DICK THATS THE SEX MACHINE TO ALL THE CHICKS?
Shaft.	Youre damn right. WHOS THE CAT THAT WONT COP OUT / WHEN THERES DANGER ALL ABOUT?
Shaft.	Right on.
Come on, pal! Fugu me!	THEY SAY THIS CAT SHAFT IS A BAD MOTHER...
Shut your mouth!	But Im talkin about Shaft.
I can dig it!	HES A COMPLICATED MAN BUT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HIM BUT HIS WOMAN.
Come here, boy.	Oh, man.
Nooo, I just want to have a heart-to-heart talk.	Oh.
You know, Bart, after me, youre the man around the house, and that means youre gonna have to help out with --	Oh, come on, I do plenty around here! Lisa never lifts a finger. Why dont you go yell at her?
Shut up! Bart, this is good stuff. I want to share something with you -- the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one, cover for me. Number two, oh, good idea, boss. Number three, it was like that when I got here.	Hey, this is good stuff.
Oh, Why you little --	It was like that when I got here.
Because sometimes its fun to use the good china.	Whats with the candles?
Because we love your father and enjoy his company.	Why are we really waiting for Dad?
Do you two have to sit so close to the TV? Back up, or itll hurt your eyes.	Oh, it will not.
I love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.	Hey, what gives?
All right, all right. Time for Dr. TV to perform a little surgery.	Looks like you lost the patient, Doc.
Homer. Its not the end of the world. You know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television.	You lie!
Whoa--	Im livin it but I aint lovin it.
So, it was love at first sight.	It was a jailhouse romance, man.
Why you cagey ol dog.	Great story. Positively spellbinding. Work, damn you, work!
Everything I know tells me this story doesnt end with us sitting here, and you telling it to us.	Get off the edge of your seat. They got married, had kids and bought a cheap TV. Okay?
Why are you doing this? Why cant you accept that Im here with someone else?	Wouldnt you eventually get used to it, like in a hot tub?
Oooo. Pro wrestling from Mexico. You know, down there its a real sport.	Cool. This is where Jaws eats the boat.
Cool. This is where Jaws eats the boat.	Cool. This is where Die Hard jumps through the window.
Cool. This is where Die Hard jumps through the window.	Cool. This is where Wall Street gets arrested.
All right, children. Now, I dont want you to get frightened, but its my responsibility to teach you this. Todays topic will be hell.	All right. Ive sat through mercy and Ive sat through forgiveness. Finally, we get to the good stuff.
Oh hell is a terrible place. Maggots are your sheet, worms your blanket. Theres a lake of fire burning with sulfur, youll be tormented day and night forever and ever. As a matter of fact, if you actually saw Hell, youd be so frightened, you would die.	Oh, Miss Albright.
Yes, Bart.	Are there pirates in hell?
So, what did you children learn about today?	Hell.
Bart!	Well, thats what we learned about. I sure as hell cant tell you we learned about hell unless I say hell, can I?
The lad has a point.	Hell, yes.
Bart!	Hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell.
Whats gotten into Lisa?	Beats the hell out of me.
Bart!	Ehhhh!
Youre watching Top Hat Entertainment. Adult programming all day, every day, except in Florida and Utah. Coming up next, Stardust Memories.	Aye Carumba!
Bart!	Dad!
Dad!	Oh, heres what I was looking for.
Son, you shouldnt watch that other channel. Its only for mommies and daddies who love each other very much. I want you to promise me you wont watch that channel ever again.	Okay.
Promise me.	I promise I will never watch that channel again.
Marge, we cant be too careful. There are thieves everywhere, and Im not talking about the small, forgivable stuff.	Come one, come all, Top Hat Theatre is on the air. The most beautiful women in the world. Just fifty-cents. I am your host, Bart Simpson. You must be at least eight years old to enter.
Come one, come all, Top Hat Theatre is on the air. The most beautiful women in the world. Just fifty-cents. I am your host, Bart Simpson. You must be at least eight years old to enter.	Well, back to the fight.
Bart, you promised me you wouldnt watch that trash! Now go to your room.	Man, I wish I was an adult so I could break the rules.
All right, the stuff I stole from work!	Oh, okay.
Go for it Dad!	Dad, I beg you to reconsider. Tractor pulls, Atlanta Braves baseball, Joe Franklin...
That will do.	Whats this stuff for?
Its chiefly used in the manufacture of rayons, film, and as a preservative in fast foods. Its also quite a potent herbicide.	Whats a herbicide?
It kills grass.	Excellent.
Gentlemen, according to my sources you are planning to simultaneously drop your pencils at 215 this afternoon. Do so and you will be suspended.	Vandalism fans, hold on to your hats!
Bart, Im flabbergasted. Surely you knew, as you were writing your own name in forty-foot-high letters in the field, that you would be caught.	Maybe it was one of the other Barts, Sir.
There are no other Barts!	Uh-oh.
Call your father immediately.	Hello, is Homer there?
Homer who?	Homer Sexual.
Well thank you, Bart. I only hope that for the next few hours you and I can leave our differences in the schoolyard.	Fine. Now just get inside already.
Bart, you wouldnt happen to know what sort of candy your Aunt Patty likes, would you?	Cherry cordials, sir.
Very good. Now then, regarding your punishment... do you feel that youve learned your lesson?	Have I ever. Just the thought of doing anything bad again makes my stomach turn.
Well, then, you are free to go.	Well, Willie, you can take it from here. Adios, dude.
Bart, Skinners gonna kill you.	Skinner? He works for me now.
Simpson!	Uh oh.
I wanted you to be the first to know. Im going to ask for your Aunt Pattys hand in marriage.	Your funeral, Seymour.
I cant afford that! Im an educator.	Seymour?
Bart, come cheer up your Aunt Selma.	Okay.
What did you learn in school today?	Principal Skinner is going to ask Aunt Patty to marry him.
Dad, Bart ate a green bean during the blessing.	How do you know unless you opened your eyes during the blessing?
Eating is worse than opening eyes.	Is not.
Is too.	Is not.
Is too.	Is not.
We didnt say anything.	Not one word.
A long-lost half-brother. How Dickensian!	So, any idea where this bastard lives?
Bart!	Well his parents arent married, are they? Its the correct word, isnt it?
Bart!	BASTARD / BASTARD, BASTARD!
... and our three children, Bart, Lisa and Maggie.	Hello, sir.
No, sir. I can assure you I am not.	Im the little hell-raiser, sir.
Your old man sure loves pork chops.	He sure does, Uncle Herb.
Bart, Uncle Herb sounds so formal. Do you think you could call me Unky Herb?	No problemo, Unky Herb.
Marco!	Polo!
Marco!	Polo!
A millionaire!... I kept the wrong one. Look son, Ill come as soon as I can get outta here. In the meantime, pleeze dont do anything stupid.	Unky Herb, can I spit over the side?
I love this kid. Hock your brains out.	Ohh, oh, got him.
I want to go on a pony ride, Unky Herb.	I want to go on a boat ride, Unky Herb.
Pony ride!	Boat ride!
Pony ride!	Boat ride!
Pony ride! Boat ride! Pony ride! Boat ride!	Ahoy, Mateys!
Oh, okay.	Batting nine. Unky, Herbbbb!
Uh huh.	They hate each other.
What is it, boy?	I thought your car was really cool.
Mm hm. Two oclock is fine. Thank you, Dr. Hibbert.	No way! Shes faking! If Lisa stays home, I stay home.
If Bart stays home, Im going to school.	Fine. Then...
Fine. Then...	Wait a minute. If Lisa goes to school then I go to school, but then Lisa stays home so I stay home, so Lisa goes to school...
Get my homework from Mrs. Hoover.	Homework? Lisa, you wasted chicken pox. Dont waste the mumps.
Hey, Bart-dude.	Hey, Otto-man.
Yo, hairy bro.	Go home, boy! Go... home!
I didnt know then, and I dont know now.	Heres your stupid homework.
Eight. Thanks, Dad.	Whoa! Assassins!
Those are very elaborate sneakers.	They better be for a hundred and twenty-five big ones!
Well, Homer. There seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here.	Oh school! Right. Yeah, thats your answer for everything!
Now, if I could borrow... Satans Little Helper...	Santas Little Helper.
The dogs eyes will cross and his tongue will protrude and change color ever so slightly.	Is my dog dead, maam?
There are two ways for a dog to relieve himself. One is like a faithful friend and partner for life. The other is like a hose without a fireman. Which way do you think that was, Mr. Simpson?	Like a hose, your wrinkled highness.
Look, Mom, I finished my patch. It depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life.	Miss Winthrop, I was thinking...
Everybody in the kitchen! Were having a family meeting!	We never had a family meeting before.
Im saying...	No way! You cant give my dog away! Ill set fire to my hair! Ill rip up all my clothes! Ill put sugar in the gas tank!
Homer, please. Its not just the quilt. Hes a nice dog, but he chews up everything. He doesnt obey. Hes not even housebroken. And weve spent all this money on an obedience school and I dont see any improvement.	All right, all right. If Santas Little Helper studies real hard and passes his finals and becomes a perfect dog, can we keep him then?
No.	Dad!
Tch, tch. Oh, dear.	...since you get paid either way, would it be a big deal to just let my dog pass?
Yea!	All right!
Congratulations, sonny. Youve earned a toffee.	Oh, thank you, you moldy old maid.
Now, sit! I said sit!	Uh... Take a walk!
Uh... Take a walk!	Sniff that other dogs butt! See, he does exactly what I tell him.
Now... stayyy!	Stay boy! Stay! Stay! Stayyy!!
I see. Rubber stamp, thank you very much, next in line! Is that it?	Yeah!
Heavens to Mergatroid! Bart, perhaps I cling to the old ways like a well-chewed shoe as the traditions I was weaned on are put to sleep or neutered, one by one. But my time has not passed yet! The world does not need another college graduate who doesnt know how to sit!	Hell sit, hell sit. Come on, boy. Sit! Sit!
Pull the chain!	Huh?
Correct the dog!	I dont want to strangle my dog.
PULL THE BLOODY CHAIN, BOY!	Im sorry, boy. You cant help being dumb.
Well, you certainly captured the moment. Hmmm .	Come on, boy, sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Oh, man!
Bart, hes not gonna learn it now. Dont spend your last hours together tormenting the poor creature. Have some fun, frolic with him. Go get it, boy!	Im gonna miss you, boy.
Im gonna miss you, boy.	I thought we were gonna be pals forever. But, were gonna have to say goodbye, because you dont understand a single word I say. If you just knew how important it was to learn sit...
I thought we were gonna be pals forever. But, were gonna have to say goodbye, because you dont understand a single word I say. If you just knew how important it was to learn sit...	Wait a minute! You did it!
Wait a minute! You did it!	... lay down...
... lay down...	... shake hands?... stay!
... shake hands?... stay!	... speak!
... speak!	All right! Good boy! Roll over!
Say goodbye to Grampa, everyone.	Bye.
My God, youre right, Marge. You kids wouldnt put me in a home like I did to my dad, would you?	Well...
Yes!	Bo-ring.
Oh, we saw that.	The Museum of Barnyard Oddities.
Yeah, Bart, get out and push.	No way, JosÃ©.
Homer, this thing with your Dad has had you moping around the house for days. I think its time for you to talk to someone who understands.	Nunchucks.
Hi ya, you have reached Dr. Marvin Monroes Anxiety Line. If you have a sullen teenager, press one, now. If youre estranged from your spouse, press two, now. If you have trouble maintaining an...	Grampa!
Well... sure. Well have to move a chair in from the den, but its no problem. Bart!	Choose your corncob! En garde!
Grampa, thats the noblest thought thats ever been expressed at this table.	Give it to us, Grampa.
This is Kent Brockman on line for an old mans money.	Yeah.
Hm, interesting.	Lets see, I want a teargas can, a blue gun with paralyzer darts...
Lets see, I want a teargas can, a blue gun with paralyzer darts...	A copy of Radioactive Man number 27. Thats the first time he fights Dr. Crab. Then I wanna buy that baseball card where the guy is flippin the bird.
Oh yeah, Ive seen that one.	Oh and the
This is a rather shameless promotion.	Hey, it worked on me.
If I take you, will you two SHUT UP AND QUIT BUGGING ME?	Yeah.
YES!!!	Thanks, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.	Cmon Homer. Get the lead out!
Whoooooaaaa!	All right! No line!
All right! No line!	Aye carumba!
Aye carumba!	Okay, Lis. Turn on the waterworks, babe.
Mommy! I want my mommy!	Step aside. Come on. Spread out, spread out. Lost kid. Comin through. Look out, fatso. Comin through. Comin through. Pardon me. Movin to the front of the line. Hey, Lis, nice work, babe.
Dont you ever do that to me again.	Okay.
Get away from that thing and help me find my athletic equipment.	Hey, Homer, I found your weights.
Ooh, the Glutimus Maximizer.	Hey, whos the moptop with the big schnozz?
I cant move, boy.	Oh really.
Way to go, Dad.	You look mahvelous.
Im so sorry, Mr. Burns.	Hey, Mom. Did he have those spots all over his body?
I heard that.	Oops.
Mrs. Krabappel, hes traumatizing the children.	More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos! More asbestos!
Bart Simpson... I know its you.	And here comes Snowball II. This is the one we kept.
Ewwwwwww!	We were going to keep the gray one, but the mother ate her.
As usual, I agree with you, Martin. Bart, shut that off and take your seat immediately.	Oh look, this is really cool. When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in.
Speech! Speech!	I had a speech ready... but my dog ate it!
Would you do it for me?	Why, Mrs. Krabappel! How would I know where the principals office is?
A book made him cry! Boo hoo hoo!	Waaaaaaaah!
In a sample taken in this very classroom, a state inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos --	Thats not enough! We demand more asbestos! More Asbestos!
Wow! You made the front page.	Aw, Dad. Its just a popularity contest.
Just a popularity contest?! Excuse me, whats more important than popularity? Now, Bart, do you really think you can win?	Sure, why not?
Woo woo! All right! I always knew you had personality. The doctors said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better. President Simpson. Has a nice ring to it, doesnt it, boy?	Hm, yeah.
Now, go get em.	He says, there arent any easy answers! I say, hes not looking hard enough!
Homer, Ive been talking to Lisa and Im concerned about your relationship with her.	Me, too, Mom. I think theyre drifting apart.
